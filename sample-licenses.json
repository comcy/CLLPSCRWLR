At server side we've used IdentityServer (.NET/ .NET Core) and Redhat's Keycloak (Java).\r\n\r\n## New Features in Version 3.1\r\n\r\nSee [Release Notes](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/angular-oauth2-oidc/releases/tag/3.1)\r\n\r\n## New Features in Version 3.0\r\n\r\nSee [Release Notes](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/angular-oauth2-oidc/releases/tag/3.0.1)\r\n\r\n## New Features in Version 2.1\r\n- New Config API (the original one is still supported)\r\n- New convenience methods in OAuthService to streamline default tasks:\r\n    - ``setupAutomaticSilentRefresh()``\r\n    - ``loadDiscoveryDocumentAndTryLogin()``\r\n- Single Sign out through Session Status Change Notification according to the OpenID Connect Session Management specs. This means, you can be notified when the user logs out using at the login provider.\r\n- Possibility to define the ValidationHandler, the Config as well as the OAuthStorage via DI\r\n- Better structured documentation\r\n\r\n## New Features in Version 2\r\n- Token Refresh for Implicit Flow by implementing \"silent refresh\"\r\n- Validating the signature of the received id_token\r\n- Providing Events via the observable ``events``.\r\n- The event ``token_expires`` can be used together with a silent refresh to automatically refresh a token when/ before it expires (see also property ``timeoutFactor``).\r\n\r\n## Additional Features \r\n- Logging in via OAuth2 and OpenId Connect (OIDC) Implicit Flow (where user is redirected to Identity Provider)\r\n- \"Logging in\" via Password Flow (where user enters his/her password into the client)\r\n- Token Refresh for Password Flow by using a Refresh Token\r\n- Automatically refreshing a token when/ some time before it expires\r\n- Querying Userinfo Endpoint\r\n- Querying Discovery Document to ease configuration\r\n- Validating claims of the id_token regarding the specs\r\n- Hook for further custom validations\r\n- Single-Sign-Out by redirecting to the auth-server's logout-endpoint\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes in Version 2\r\n- The property ``oidc`` defaults to ``true``.\r\n- If you are just using oauth2, you have to set ``oidc`` to ``false``. Otherwise, the validation of the user profile will fail!\r\n- By default, ``sessionStorage`` is used. To use ``localStorage`` call method setStorage\r\n- Demands using https as OIDC and OAuth2 relay on it. This rule can be relaxed using the property ``requireHttps``, e. g. for local testing.\r\n- Demands that every url provided by the discovery document starts with the issuer's url. This can be relaxed by using the property ``strictDiscoveryDocumentValidation``.\r\n\r\n## Sample-Auth-Server\r\n\r\nYou can use the OIDC-Sample-Server mentioned in the samples for Testing. It assumes, that your Web-App runns on http://localhost:8080.\r\n\r\nUsername/Password: max/geheim\r\n\r\n*clientIds:* \r\n- spa-demo (implicit flow)\r\n- demo-resource-owner (resource owner password flow)\r\n\r\n*redirectUris:*\r\n- localhost:[8080-8089|4200-4202]\r\n- localhost:[8080-8089|4200-4202]/index.html\r\n- localhost:[8080-8089|4200-4202]/silent-refresh.html\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm i angular-oauth2-oidc --save\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Importing the NgModule\r\n\r\n```TypeScript\r\nimport { OAuthModule } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';\r\n[...]\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  imports: [ \r\n    [...]\r\n    HttpModule,\r\n    OAuthModule.forRoot()\r\n  ],\r\n  declarations: [\r\n    AppComponent,\r\n    HomeComponent,\r\n    [...]\r\n  ],\r\n  bootstrap: [\r\n    AppComponent \r\n  ]\r\n})\r\nexport class AppModule {\r\n}\r\n\r\n``` \r\n\r\n## Configuring for Implicit Flow\r\n\r\nThis section shows how to implement login leveraging implicit flow. This is the OAuth2/OIDC flow best suitable for\r\nSingle Page Application. It sends the user to the Identity Provider's login page. After logging in, the SPA gets tokens.\r\nThis also allows for single sign on as well as single sign off.\r\n\r\nTo configure the library the following sample uses the new configuration API introduced with Version 2.1.\r\nHence, The original API is still supported.\r\n\r\n```TypeScript\r\nimport { AuthConfig } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';\r\n\r\nexport const authConfig: AuthConfig = {\r\n\r\n  // Url of the Identity Provider\r\n  issuer: 'https://steyer-identity-server.azurewebsites.net/identity',\r\n\r\n  // URL of the SPA to redirect the user to after login\r\n  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/index.html',\r\n\r\n  // The SPA's id. The SPA is registerd with this id at the auth-server\r\n  clientId: 'spa-demo',\r\n\r\n  // set the scope for the permissions the client should request\r\n  // The first three are defined by OIDC. The 4th is a usecase-specific one\r\n  scope: 'openid profile email voucher',\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nConfigure the OAuthService with this config object when the application starts up:\r\n\r\n```TypeScript\r\nimport { OAuthService } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';\r\nimport { JwksValidationHandler } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';\r\nimport { authConfig } from './auth.config';\r\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n    selector: 'flight-app',\r\n    templateUrl: './app.component.html'\r\n})\r\nexport class AppComponent {\r\n\r\n    constructor(private oauthService: OAuthService) {\r\n      this.configureWithNewConfigApi();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private configureWithNewConfigApi() {\r\n      this.oauthService.configure(authConfig);\r\n      this.oauthService.tokenValidationHandler = new JwksValidationHandler();\r\n      this.oauthService.loadDiscoveryDocumentAndTryLogin();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Implementing a Login Form\r\n\r\nAfter you've configured the library, you just have to call ``initImplicitFlow`` to login using OAuth2/ OIDC.\r\n\r\n```TypeScript\r\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { OAuthService } from 'angular-oauth2-oidc';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n    templateUrl: \"app/home.html\"\r\n})\r\nexport class HomeComponent {\r\n\r\n    constructor(private oauthService: OAuthService) {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public login() {\r\n        this.oauthService.initImplicitFlow();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public logoff() {\r\n        this.oauthService.logOut();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public get name() {\r\n        let claims = this.oauthService.getIdentityClaims();\r\n        if (!claims) return null;\r\n        return claims.given_name;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following snippet contains the template for the login page:\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n<h1 *ngIf=\"!name\">\r\n    Hallo\r\n</h1>\r\n<h1 *ngIf=\"name\">\r\n    Hallo, {{name}}\r\n</h1>\r\n\r\n<button class=\"btn btn-default\" (click)=\"login()\">\r\n    Login\r\n</button>\r\n<button class=\"btn btn-default\" (click)=\"logoff()\">\r\n    Logout\r\n</button>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n    Username/Passwort zum Testen: max/geheim\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Skipping the Login Form\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to display a login form that tells the user that they are redirected to the identity server, you can use the convenince function ``this.oauthService.loadDiscoveryDocumentAndLogin();`` instead of ``this.oauthService.loadDiscoveryDocumentAndTryLogin();`` when setting up the library. \r\n\r\nThis directly redirects the user to the identity server if there are no valid tokens. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Calling a Web API with an Access Token\r\n\r\nPass this Header to the used method of the ``Http``-Service within an Instance of the class ``Headers``:\r\n\r\n```TypeScript\r\nvar headers = new Headers({\r\n    \"Authorization\": \"Bearer \" + this.oauthService.getAccessToken()\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using the new ``HttpClient``, use the class ``HttpHeaders`` instead:\r\n\r\n```TypeScript\r\nvar headers = new HttpHeaders({\r\n    \"Authorization\": \"Bearer \" + this.oauthService.getAccessToken()\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince 3.1 you can also automate this task by switching ``sendAccessToken`` on and by setting ``allowedUrls`` to an array with prefixes for the respective urls. Use lower case for the prefixes.\r\n\r\n```TypeScript\r\nOAuthModule.forRoot({\r\n    resourceServer: {\r\n        allowedUrls: ['http://www.angular.at/api'],\r\n        sendAccessToken: true\r\n    }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Routing\r\n\r\nIf you use the ``PathLocationStragegy`` (which is on by default) and have a general catch-all-route (``path: '**'``) you should be fine. Otherwise look up the section ``Routing with the HashStrategy`` in the [documation](https://manfredsteyer.github.io/angular-oauth2-oidc/angular-oauth2-oidc/docs/).\r\n\r\n\r\n## More Documentation\r\n\r\nSee the [documentation](https://manfredsteyer.github.io/angular-oauth2-oidc/angular-oauth2-oidc/docs/) for more information about this library.",

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\n      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\n      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright {yyyy} {name of copyright owner}\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License.",

As a simple example, most of my code looks\nlike this:\n\n```javascript\n    var assert = require('assert-plus');\n\n    function fooAccount(options, callback) {\n        assert.object(options, 'options');\n        assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');\n        assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');\n        assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');\n        assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');\n        assert.func(callback, 'callback');\n\n        // Do stuff\n        callback(null, {});\n    }\n```\n\n# API\n\nAll methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to\ntake an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`\nwill be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:\n\n    AssertionError: foo (string) is required\n    at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)\n    at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)\n    at Object..js (module.js:464:10)\n    at Module.load (module.js:353:31)\n    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)\n    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)\n    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)\n\nfrom:\n\n```javascript\n    function test(foo) {\n        assert.string(foo, 'foo');\n    }\n```\n\nThere you go.

This is pseudo-useful if you have\nlots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in\nproduction.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are\nalso disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.

However,\nyou may be dealing with AST constructed from multiple sources - JS files, templates, etc.\nIf this is the case, and you want the sourcemaps to reflect the correct sources, you'll need\nto pass an object to `generate` as the `code` parameter.  Keys\nshould be the source filenames, and values should be the source content.\n\nHere's an example of what that might look like:\n\n```js\nimport {parse} from 'babylon';\nimport generate from 'babel-generator';\n\nconst a = 'var a = 1;';\nconst b = 'var b = 2;';\nconst astA = parse(a, { sourceFilename: 'a.js' });\nconst astB = parse(b, { sourceFilename: 'b.js' });\nconst ast = {\n  type: 'Program',\n  body: [].concat(astA.program.body, astB.program.body)\n};\n\nconst { code, map } = generate(ast, { sourceMaps: true }, {\n  'a.js': a,\n  'b.js': b\n});\n\n// Sourcemap will point to both a.js and b.js where appropriate.\n```",

Here\nis the list of them in the order of appearance in the function name:\n\n* `i` - perform operation in-place, storing the result in the host object (on\n  which the method was invoked). Might be used to avoid number allocation costs\n* `u` - unsigned, ignore the sign of operands when performing operation, or\n  always return positive value. Second case applies to reduction operations\n  like `mod()`. In such cases if the result will be negative - modulo will be\n  added to the result to make it positive\n\n### Postfixes\n\nThe only available postfix at the moment is:\n\n* `n` - which means that the argument of the function must be a plain JavaScript\n  Number. Decimals are not supported.\n\n### Examples\n\n* `a.iadd(b)` - perform addition on `a` and `b`, storing the result in `a`\n* `a.umod(b)` - reduce `a` modulo `b`, returning positive value\n* `a.iushln(13)` - shift bits of `a` left by 13\n\n## Instructions\n\nPrefixes/postfixes are put in parens at the of the line. `endian` - could be\neither `le` (little-endian) or `be` (big-endian).\n\n### Utilities\n\n* `a.clone()` - clone number\n* `a.toString(base, length)` - convert to base-string and pad with zeroes\n* `a.toNumber()` - convert to Javascript Number (limited to 53 bits)\n* `a.toJSON()` - convert to JSON compatible hex string (alias of `toString(16)`)\n* `a.toArray(endian, length)` - convert to byte `Array`, and optionally zero\n  pad to length, throwing if already exceeding\n* `a.toArrayLike(type, endian, length)` - convert to an instance of `type`,\n  which must behave like an `Array`\n* `a.toBuffer(endian, length)` - convert to Node.js Buffer (if available). For\n  compatibility with browserify and similar tools, use this instead:\n  `a.toArrayLike(Buffer, endian, length)`\n* `a.bitLength()` - get number of bits occupied\n* `a.zeroBits()` - return number of less-significant consequent zero bits\n  (example: `1010000` has 4 zero bits)\n* `a.byteLength()` - return number of bytes occupied\n* `a.isNeg()` - true if the number is negative\n* `a.isEven()` - no comments\n* `a.isOdd()` - no comments\n* `a.isZero()` - no comments\n* `a.cmp(b)` - compare numbers and return `-1` (a `<` b), `0` (a `==` b), or `1` (a `>` b)\n  depending on the comparison result (`ucmp`, `cmpn`)\n* `a.lt(b)` - `a` less than `b` (`n`)\n* `a.lte(b)` - `a` less than or equals `b` (`n`)\n* `a.gt(b)` - `a` greater than `b` (`n`)\n* `a.gte(b)` - `a` greater than or equals `b` (`n`)\n* `a.eq(b)` - `a` equals `b` (`n`)\n* `a.toTwos(width)` - convert to two's complement representation, where `width` is bit width\n* `a.fromTwos(width)` - convert from two's complement representation, where `width` is the bit width\n* `BN.isBN(object)` - returns true if the supplied `object` is a BN.js instance\n\n### Arithmetics\n\n* `a.neg()` - negate sign (`i`)\n* `a.abs()` - absolute value (`i`)\n* `a.add(b)` - addition (`i`, `n`, `in`)\n* `a.sub(b)` - subtraction (`i`, `n`, `in`)\n* `a.mul(b)` - multiply (`i`, `n`, `in`)\n* `a.sqr()` - square (`i`)\n* `a.pow(b)` - raise `a` to the power of `b`\n* `a.div(b)` - divide (`divn`, `idivn`)\n* `a.mod(b)` - reduct (`u`, `n`) (but no `umodn`)\n* `a.divRound(b)` - rounded division\n\n### Bit operations\n\n* `a.or(b)` - or (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.and(b)` - and (`i`, `u`, `iu`, `andln`) (NOTE: `andln` is going to be replaced\n  with `andn` in future)\n* `a.xor(b)` - xor (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.setn(b)` - set specified bit to `1`\n* `a.shln(b)` - shift left (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.shrn(b)` - shift right (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.testn(b)` - test if specified bit is set\n* `a.maskn(b)` - clear bits with indexes higher or equal to `b` (`i`)\n* `a.bincn(b)` - add `1 << b` to the number\n* `a.notn(w)` - not (for the width specified by `w`) (`i`)\n\n### Reduction\n\n* `a.gcd(b)` - GCD\n* `a.egcd(b)` - Extended GCD results (`{ a: ..., b: ..., gcd: ... }`)\n* `a.invm(b)` - inverse `a` modulo `b`\n\n## Fast reduction\n\nWhen doing lots of reductions using the same modulo, it might be beneficial to\nuse some tricks: like [Montgomery multiplication][0], or using special algorithm\nfor [Mersenne Prime][1].\n\n### Reduction context\n\nTo enable this tricks one should create a reduction context:\n\n```js\nvar red = BN.red(num);\n```\nwhere `num` is just a BN instance.\n\nOr:\n\n```js\nvar red = BN.red(primeName);\n```\n\nWhere `primeName` is either of these [Mersenne Primes][1]:\n\n* `'k256'`\n* `'p224'`\n* `'p192'`\n* `'p25519'`\n\nOr:\n\n```js\nvar red = BN.mont(num);\n```\n\nTo reduce numbers with [Montgomery trick][0]. `.mont()` is generally faster than\n`.red(num)`, but slower than `BN.red(primeName)`.\n\n### Converting numbers\n\nBefore performing anything in reduction context - numbers should be converted\nto it. Usually, this means that one should:\n\n* Convert inputs to reducted ones\n* Operate on them in reduction context\n* Convert outputs back from the reduction context\n\nHere is how one may convert numbers to `red`:\n\n```js\nvar redA = a.toRed(red);\n```\nWhere `red` is a reduction context created using instructions above\n\nHere is how to convert them back:\n\n```js\nvar a = redA.fromRed();\n```\n\n### Red instructions\n\nMost of the instructions from the very start of this readme have their\ncounterparts in red context:\n\n* `a.redAdd(b)`, `a.redIAdd(b)`\n* `a.redSub(b)`, `a.redISub(b)`\n* `a.redShl(num)`\n* `a.redMul(b)`, `a.redIMul(b)`\n* `a.redSqr()`, `a.redISqr()`\n* `a.redSqrt()` - square root modulo reduction context's prime\n* `a.redInvm()` - modular inverse of the number\n* `a.redNeg()`\n* `a.redPow(b)` - modular exponentiation\n\n## LICENSE\n\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\n\nCopyright Fedor Indutny, 2015.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.\n\n###And why is this a separate module?\n\nI'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions.

The\nfollowing considerations are for informational purposes only, are not\nexhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are\n     intended for use by those authorized to give the public\n     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\n     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\n     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any\n     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-\n     licensed material, or material used under an exception or\n     limitation to copyright.

If\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material.

To the\nextent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are\ngranted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of\nthese terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in\nconsideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the\nLicensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\nSection 1 -- Definitions.\n\n  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n  c.

For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.\n\n  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\n  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright\n     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of\n     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,\n     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially\n     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\n  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 -- Scope.\n\n  a. License grant.\n\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

Cheerio removes all the DOM inconsistencies and browser cruft from the jQuery library, revealing its truly gorgeous API.\n\n__&#991; Blazingly fast:__\nCheerio works with a very simple, consistent DOM model. As a result parsing, manipulating, and rendering are incredibly efficient. Preliminary end-to-end benchmarks suggest that cheerio is about __8x__ faster than JSDOM.\n\n__&#10049; Incredibly flexible:__\nCheerio wraps around @FB55's forgiving [htmlparser2](https://github.com/fb55/htmlparser2/). Cheerio can parse nearly any HTML or XML document.\n\n## Sponsors\n\nDoes your company use Cheerio in production? Please consider [sponsoring this project](https://opencollective.com/cheerio#sponsor). Your help will allow maintainers to dedicate more time and resources to its development and support.\n\n<a href=\"https://opencollective.com/cheerio/sponsor/0/website\" target=\"_blank\"><img

src=\"https://opencollective.com/cheerio/backer/29/avatar.svg\"></a>\n\n## API\n\n### Markup example we'll be using:\n\n```html\n<ul id=\"fruits\">\n  <li class=\"apple\">Apple</li>\n  <li class=\"orange\">Orange</li>\n  <li class=\"pear\">Pear</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nThis is the HTML markup we will be using in all of the API examples.\n\n### Loading\nFirst you need to load in the HTML. This step in jQuery is implicit, since jQuery operates on the one, baked-in DOM. With Cheerio, we need to pass in the HTML document.\n\nThis is the _preferred_ method:\n\n```js\nvar cheerio = require('cheerio'),\n    $ = cheerio.load('<ul id=\"fruits\">...</ul>');\n```\n\nOptionally, you can also load in the HTML by passing the string as the context:\n\n```js\n$ = require('cheerio');\n$('ul', '<ul id=\"fruits\">...</ul>');\n```\n\nOr as the root:\n\n```js\n$ = require('cheerio');\n$('li', 'ul', '<ul id=\"fruits\">...</ul>');\n```\n\nYou can also pass an extra object to `.load()` if you need to modify any\nof the default parsing options:\n\n```js\n$ = cheerio.load('<ul id=\"fruits\">...</ul>', {\n    normalizeWhitespace: true,\n    xmlMode: true\n});\n```\n\nThese parsing options are taken directly from [htmlparser2](https://github.com/fb55/htmlparser2/wiki/Parser-options), therefore any options that can be used in `htmlparser2` are valid in cheerio as well. The default options are:\n\n```js\n{\n    withDomLvl1: true,\n    normalizeWhitespace: false,\n    xmlMode: false,\n    decodeEntities: true\n}\n\n```\n\nFor a full list of options and their effects, see [this](https://github.com/fb55/DomHandler) and\n[htmlparser2's options](https://github.com/fb55/htmlparser2/wiki/Parser-options).\n\n### Selectors\n\nCheerio's selector implementation is nearly identical to jQuery's, so the API is very similar.\n\n#### $( selector, [context], [root] )\n`selector` searches within the `context` scope which searches within the `root` scope. `selector` and `context` can be a string expression, DOM Element, array of DOM elements, or cheerio object. `root` is typically the HTML document string.\n\nThis selector method is the starting point for traversing and manipulating the document. Like jQuery, it's the primary method for selecting elements in the document, but unlike jQuery it's built on top of the CSSSelect library, which implements most of the Sizzle selectors.\n\n```js\n$('.apple', '#fruits').text()\n//=> Apple\n\n$('ul .pear').attr('class')\n//=> pear\n\n$('li[class=orange]').html()\n//=> Orange\n```\n\n### Attributes\nMethods for getting and modifying attributes.\n\n#### .attr( name, value )\nMethod for getting and setting attributes. Gets the attribute value for only the first element in the matched set. If you set an attribute's value to `null`, you remove that attribute. You may also pass a `map` and `function` like jQuery.\n\n```js\n$('ul').attr('id')\n//=> fruits\n\n$('.apple').attr('id', 'favorite').html()\n//=> <li class=\"apple\" id=\"favorite\">Apple</li>\n```\n\n> See http://api.jquery.com/attr/ for more information\n\n#### .prop( name, value )\nMethod for getting and setting properties. Gets the property value for only the first element in the matched set.\n\n```js\n$('input[type=\"checkbox\"]').prop('checked')\n//=> false\n\n$('input[type=\"checkbox\"]').prop('checked', true).val()\n//=> ok\n```\n\n> See http://api.jquery.com/prop/ for more information\n\n#### .data( name, value )\nMethod for getting and setting data attributes. Gets or sets the data attribute value for only the first element in the matched set.\n\n```js\n$('<div data-apple-color=\"red\"></div>').data()\n//=> { appleColor: 'red' }\n\n$('<div data-apple-color=\"red\"></div>').data('apple-color')\n//=> 'red'\n\nvar apple = $('.apple').data('kind', 'mac')\napple.data('kind')\n//=> 'mac'\n```\n\n> See http://api.jquery.com/data/ for more information\n\n#### .val( [value] )\nMethod for getting and setting the value of input, select, and textarea. Note: Support for `map`, and `function` has not been added yet.\n\n```js\n$('input[type=\"text\"]').val()\n//=> input_text\n\n$('input[type=\"text\"]').val('test').html()\n//=> <input type=\"text\" value=\"test\"/>\n```\n\n#### .removeAttr( name )\nMethod for removing attributes by `name`.\n\n```js\n$('.pear').removeAttr('class').html()\n//=> <li>Pear</li>\n```\n\n#### .hasClass( className )\nCheck to see if *any* of the matched elements have the given `className`.\n\n```js\n$('.pear').hasClass('pear')\n//=> true\n\n$('apple').hasClass('fruit')\n//=> false\n\n$('li').hasClass('pear')\n//=> true\n```\n\n#### .addClass( className )\nAdds class(es) to all of the matched elements. Also accepts a `function` like jQuery.\n\n```js\n$('.pear').addClass('fruit').html()\n//=> <li class=\"pear fruit\">Pear</li>\n\n$('.apple').addClass('fruit red').html()\n//=> <li class=\"apple fruit red\">Apple</li>\n```\n\n> See http://api.jquery.com/addClass/ for more information.\n\n#### .removeClass( [className] )\nRemoves one or more space-separated classes from the selected elements. If no `className` is defined, all classes will be removed. Also accepts a `function` like jQuery.\n\n```js\n$('.pear').removeClass('pear').html()\n//=> <li class=\"\">Pear</li>\n\n$('.apple').addClass('red').removeClass().html()\n//=> <li class=\"\">Apple</li>\n```\n\n> See http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/ for more information.\n\n#### .toggleClass( className, [switch] )\nAdd or remove class(es) from the matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. Also accepts a `function` like jQuery.\n\n```js\n$('.apple.green').toggleClass('fruit green red').html()\n//=> <li class=\"apple fruit red\">Apple</li>\n\n$('.apple.green').toggleClass('fruit green red', true).html()\n//=> <li class=\"apple green fruit red\">Apple</li>\n```\n\n> See http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/ for more information.\n\n#### .is( selector )\n#### .is( element )\n#### .is( selection )\n#### .is( function(index) )\nChecks the current list of elements and returns `true` if _any_ of the elements match the selector. If using an element or Cheerio selection, returns `true` if _any_ of the elements match. If using a predicate function, the function is executed in the context of the selected element, so `this` refers to the current element.\n\n### Forms\n\n#### .serializeArray()\n\nEncode a set of form elements as an array of names and values.\n\n```js\n$('<form><input name=\"foo\" value=\"bar\" /></form>').serializeArray()\n//=> [ { name: 'foo', value: 'bar' } ]\n```\n\n### Traversing\n\n#### .find(selector)\n#### .find(selection)\n#### .find(node)\nGet the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element.\n\n```js\n$('#fruits').find('li').length\n//=> 3\n$('#fruits').find($('.apple')).length\n//=> 1\n```\n\n#### .parent([selector])\nGet the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector.\n\n```js\n$('.pear').parent().attr('id')\n//=> fruits\n```\n\n#### .parents([selector])\nGet a set of parents filtered by `selector` of each element in the current set of match elements.\n```js\n$('.orange').parents().length\n// => 2\n$('.orange').parents('#fruits').length\n// => 1\n```\n\n#### .parentsUntil([selector][,filter])\nGet the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, up to but not including the element matched by the selector, DOM node, or cheerio object.\n```js\n$('.orange').parentsUntil('#food').length\n// => 1\n```\n\n#### .closest(selector)\nFor each element in the set, get the first element that matches the selector by testing the element itself and traversing up through its ancestors in the DOM tree.\n\n```js\n$('.orange').closest()\n// => []\n$('.orange').closest('.apple')\n// => []\n$('.orange').closest('li')\n// => [<li class=\"orange\">Orange</li>]\n$('.orange').closest('#fruits')\n// => [<ul id=\"fruits\"> ... </ul>]\n```\n\n#### .next([selector])\nGets the next sibling of the first selected element, optionally filtered by a selector.\n\n```js\n$('.apple').next().hasClass('orange')\n//=> true\n```\n\n#### .nextAll([selector])\nGets all the following siblings of the first selected element, optionally filtered by a selector.\n\n```js\n$('.apple').nextAll()\n//=> [<li class=\"orange\">Orange</li>, <li class=\"pear\">Pear</li>]\n$('.apple').nextAll('.orange')\n//=> [<li class=\"orange\">Orange</li>]\n```\n\n#### .nextUntil([selector], [filter])\nGets all the following siblings up to but not including the element matched by the selector, optionally filtered by another selector.\n\n```js\n$('.apple').nextUntil('.pear')\n//=> [<li class=\"orange\">Orange</li>]\n```\n\n#### .prev([selector])\nGets the previous sibling of the first selected element optionally filtered by a selector.\n\n```js\n$('.orange').prev().hasClass('apple')\n//=> true\n```\n\n#### .prevAll([selector])\nGets all the preceding siblings of the first selected element, optionally filtered by a selector.\n\n```js\n$('.pear').prevAll()\n//=> [<li class=\"orange\">Orange</li>, <li class=\"apple\">Apple</li>]\n$('.pear').prevAll('.orange')\n//=> [<li class=\"orange\">Orange</li>]\n```\n\n#### .prevUntil([selector], [filter])\nGets all the preceding siblings up to but not including the element matched by the selector, optionally filtered by another selector.\n\n```js\n$('.pear').prevUntil('.apple')\n//=> [<li class=\"orange\">Orange</li>]\n```\n\n#### .slice( start, [end] )\nGets the elements matching the specified range\n\n```js\n$('li').slice(1).eq(0).text()\n//=> 'Orange'\n\n$('li').slice(1, 2).length\n//=> 1\n```\n\n#### .siblings([selector])\nGets the first selected element's siblings, excluding itself.\n\n```js\n$('.pear').siblings().length\n//=> 2\n\n$('.pear').siblings('.orange').length\n//=> 1\n\n```\n\n#### .children([selector])\nGets the children of the first selected element.\n\n```js\n$('#fruits').children().length\n//=> 3\n\n$('#fruits').children('.pear').text()\n//=> Pear\n```\n\n#### .contents()\nGets the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text and comment nodes.\n\n```js\n$('#fruits').contents().length\n//=> 3\n```\n\n#### .each( function(index, element) )\nIterates over a cheerio object, executing a function for each matched element. When the callback is fired, the function is fired in the context of the DOM element, so `this` refers to the current element, which is equivalent to the function parameter `element`. To break out of the `each` loop early, return with `false`.\n\n```js\nvar fruits = [];\n\n$('li').each(function(i, elem) {\n  fruits[i] = $(this).text();\n});\n\nfruits.join(', ');\n//=> Apple, Orange, Pear\n```\n\n#### .map( function(index, element) )\nPass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new Cheerio object containing the return values. The function can return an individual data item or an array of data items to be inserted into the resulting set. If an array is returned, the elements inside the array are inserted into the set. If the function returns null or undefined, no element will be inserted.\n\n```js\n$('li').map(function(i, el) {\n  // this === el\n  return $(this).text();\n}).get().join(' ');\n//=> \"apple orange pear\"\n```\n\n#### .filter( selector ) <br /> .filter( selection ) <br /> .filter( element ) <br /> .filter( function(index) )\n\nIterates over a cheerio object, reducing the set of selector elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. When a Cheerio selection is specified, return only the elements contained in that selection. When an element is specified, return only that element (if it is contained in the original selection). If using the function method, the function is executed in the context of the selected element, so `this` refers to the current element.\n\nSelector:\n\n```js\n$('li').filter('.orange').attr('class');\n//=> orange\n```\n\nFunction:\n\n```js\n$('li').filter(function(i, el) {\n  // this === el\n  return $(this).attr('class') === 'orange';\n}).attr('class')\n//=> orange\n```\n\n#### .not( selector ) <br /> .not( selection ) <br /> .not( element ) <br /> .not( function(index, elem) )\n\nRemove elements from the set of matched elements. Given a jQuery object that represents a set of DOM elements, the `.not()` method constructs a new jQuery object from a subset of the matching elements. The supplied selector is tested against each element; the elements that don't match the selector will be included in the result. The `.not()` method can take a function as its argument in the same way that `.filter()` does. Elements for which the function returns true are excluded from the filtered set; all other elements are included.\n\nSelector:\n\n```js\n$('li').not('.apple').length;\n//=> 2\n```\n\nFunction:\n\n```js\n$('li').not(function(i, el) {\n  // this === el\n  return $(this).attr('class') === 'orange';\n}).length;\n//=> 2\n```\n\n#### .has( selector ) <br /> .has( element )\n\nFilters the set of matched elements to only those which have the given DOM element as a descendant or which have a descendant that matches the given selector. Equivalent to `.filter(':has(selector)')`.\n\nSelector:\n\n```js\n$('ul').has('.pear').attr('id');\n//=> fruits\n```\n\nElement:\n\n```js\n$('ul').has($('.pear')[0]).attr('id');\n//=> fruits\n```\n\n#### .first()\nWill select the first element of a cheerio object\n\n```js\n$('#fruits').children().first().text()\n//=> Apple\n```\n\n#### .last()\nWill select the last element of a cheerio object\n\n```js\n$('#fruits').children().last().text()\n//=> Pear\n```\n\n#### .eq( i )\nReduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. Use `.eq(-i)` to count backwards from the last selected element.\n\n```js\n$('li').eq(0).text()\n//=> Apple\n\n$('li').eq(-1).text()\n//=> Pear\n```\n\n#### .get( [i] )\n\nRetrieve the DOM elements matched by the Cheerio object. If an index is specified, retrieve one of the elements matched by the Cheerio object:\n\n```js\n$('li').get(0).tagName\n//=> li\n```\n\nIf no index is specified, retrieve all elements matched by the Cheerio object:\n\n```js\n$('li').get().length\n//=> 3\n```\n\n#### .index()\n#### .index( selector )\n#### .index( nodeOrSelection )\n\nSearch for a given element from among the matched elements.\n\n```js\n$('.pear').index()\n//=> 2\n$('.orange').index('li')\n//=> 1\n$('.apple').index($('#fruit, li'))\n//=> 1\n```\n\n#### .end()\nEnd the most recent filtering operation in the current chain and return the set of matched elements to its previous state.\n\n```js\n$('li').eq(0).end().length\n//=> 3\n```\n\n#### .add( selector [, context] )\n#### .add( element )\n#### .add( elements )\n#### .add( html )\n#### .add( selection )\nAdd elements to the set of matched elements.\n\n```js\n$('.apple').add('.orange').length\n//=> 2\n```\n\n#### .addBack( [filter] )\n\nAdd the previous set of elements on the stack to the current set, optionally filtered by a selector.\n\n```js\n$('li').eq(0).addBack('.orange').length\n//=> 2\n```\n\n### Manipulation\nMethods for modifying the DOM structure.\n\n#### .append( content, [content, ...] )\nInserts content as the *last* child of each of the selected elements.\n\n```js\n$('ul').append('<li class=\"plum\">Plum</li>')\n$.html()\n//=>  <ul id=\"fruits\">\n//      <li class=\"apple\">Apple</li>\n//      <li class=\"orange\">Orange</li>\n//      <li class=\"pear\">Pear</li>\n//      <li class=\"plum\">Plum</li>\n//    </ul>\n```\n\n#### .appendTo( target )\nInsert every element in the set of matched elements to the end of the target.\n\n```js\n$('<li class=\"plum\">Plum</li>').appendTo('#fruits')\n$.html()\n//=>  <ul id=\"fruits\">\n//      <li class=\"apple\">Apple</li>\n//      <li class=\"orange\">Orange</li>\n//      <li class=\"pear\">Pear</li>\n//      <li class=\"plum\">Plum</li>\n//    </ul>\n```\n\n#### .prepend( content, [content, ...] )\nInserts content as the *first* child of each of the selected elements.\n\n```js\n$('ul').prepend('<li class=\"plum\">Plum</li>')\n$.html()\n//=>  <ul id=\"fruits\">\n//      <li class=\"plum\">Plum</li>\n//      <li class=\"apple\">Apple</li>\n//      <li class=\"orange\">Orange</li>\n//      <li class=\"pear\">Pear</li>\n//    </ul>\n```\n\n#### .prependTo( target )\nInsert every element in the set of matched elements to the beginning of the target.\n\n```js\n$('<li class=\"plum\">Plum</li>').prependTo('#fruits')\n$.html()\n//=>  <ul id=\"fruits\">\n//      <li class=\"plum\">Plum</li>\n//      <li class=\"apple\">Apple</li>\n//      <li class=\"orange\">Orange</li>\n//      <li class=\"pear\">Pear</li>\n//    </ul>\n```\n\n#### .after( content, [content, ...] )\nInsert content next to each element in the set of matched elements.\n\n```js\n$('.apple').after('<li class=\"plum\">Plum</li>')\n$.html()\n//=>  <ul id=\"fruits\">\n//      <li class=\"apple\">Apple</li>\n//      <li class=\"plum\">Plum</li>\n//      <li class=\"orange\">Orange</li>\n//      <li class=\"pear\">Pear</li>\n//    </ul>\n```\n\n#### .insertAfter( target )\nInsert every element in the set of matched elements after the target.\n\n```js\n$('<li class=\"plum\">Plum</li>').insertAfter('.apple')\n$.html()\n//=>  <ul id=\"fruits\">\n//      <li class=\"apple\">Apple</li>\n//      <li class=\"plum\">Plum</li>\n//      <li class=\"orange\">Orange</li>\n//      <li class=\"pear\">Pear</li>\n//    </ul>\n```\n\n#### .before( content, [content, ...] )\nInsert content previous to each element in the set of matched elements.\n\n```js\n$('.apple').before('<li class=\"plum\">Plum</li>')\n$.html()\n//=>  <ul id=\"fruits\">\n//      <li class=\"plum\">Plum</li>\n//      <li class=\"apple\">Apple</li>\n//      <li class=\"orange\">Orange</li>\n//      <li class=\"pear\">Pear</li>\n//    </ul>\n```\n\n#### .insertBefore( target )\nInsert every element in the set of matched elements before the target.\n\n```js\n$('<li class=\"plum\">Plum</li>').insertBefore('.apple')\n$.html()\n//=>  <ul id=\"fruits\">\n//      <li class=\"plum\">Plum</li>\n//      <li class=\"apple\">Apple</li>\n//      <li class=\"orange\">Orange</li>\n//      <li class=\"pear\">Pear</li>\n//    </ul>\n```\n\n#### .remove( [selector] )\nRemoves the set of matched elements from the DOM and all their children. `selector` filters the set of matched elements to be removed.\n\n```js\n$('.pear').remove()\n$.html()\n//=>  <ul id=\"fruits\">\n//      <li class=\"apple\">Apple</li>\n//      <li class=\"orange\">Orange</li>\n//    </ul>\n```\n\n#### .replaceWith( content )\nReplaces matched elements with `content`.\n\n```js\nvar plum = $('<li class=\"plum\">Plum</li>')\n$('.pear').replaceWith(plum)\n$.html()\n//=> <ul id=\"fruits\">\n//     <li class=\"apple\">Apple</li>\n//     <li class=\"orange\">Orange</li>\n//     <li class=\"plum\">Plum</li>\n//   </ul>\n```\n\n#### .empty()\nEmpties an element, removing all its children.\n\n```js\n$('ul').empty()\n$.html()\n//=>  <ul id=\"fruits\"></ul>\n```\n\n#### .html( [htmlString] )\nGets an html content string from the first selected element. If `htmlString` is specified, each selected element's content is replaced by the new content.\n\n```js\n$('.orange').html()\n//=> Orange\n\n$('#fruits').html('<li class=\"mango\">Mango</li>').html()\n//=> <li class=\"mango\">Mango</li>\n```\n\n#### .text( [textString] )\nGet the combined text contents of each element in the set of matched elements, including their descendants.. If `textString` is specified, each selected element's content is replaced by the new text content.\n\n```js\n$('.orange').text()\n//=> Orange\n\n$('ul').text()\n//=>  Apple\n//    Orange\n//    Pear\n```\n\n#### .wrap( content )\nThe .wrap() function can take any string or object that could be passed to the $() factory function to specify a DOM structure. This structure may be nested several levels deep, but should contain only one inmost element. A copy of this structure will be wrapped around each of the elements in the set of matched elements. This method returns the original set of elements for chaining purposes.\n\n```js\nvar redFruit = $('<div class=\"red-fruit\"></div>')\n$('.apple').wrap(redFruit)\n\n//=> <ul id=\"fruits\">\n//     <div class=\"red-fruit\">\n//      <li class=\"apple\">Apple</li>\n//     </div>\n//     <li class=\"orange\">Orange</li>\n//     <li class=\"plum\">Plum</li>\n//   </ul>\n\nvar healthy = $('<div class=\"healthy\"></div>')\n$('li').wrap(healthy)\n\n//=> <ul id=\"fruits\">\n//     <div class=\"healthy\">\n//       <li class=\"apple\">Apple</li>\n//     </div>\n//     <div class=\"healthy\">\n//       <li class=\"orange\">Orange</li>\n//     </div>\n//     <div class=\"healthy\">\n//        <li class=\"plum\">Plum</li>\n//     </div>\n//   </ul>\n```\n\n#### .css( [propertName] ) <br /> .css( [ propertyNames] ) <br /> .css( [propertyName], [value] ) <br /> .css( [propertName], [function] ) <br /> .css( [properties] )\n\nGet the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements or set one or more CSS properties for every matched element.\n\n### Rendering\nWhen you're ready to render the document, you can use the `html` utility function:\n\n```js\n$.html()\n//=>  <ul id=\"fruits\">\n//      <li class=\"apple\">Apple</li>\n//      <li class=\"orange\">Orange</li>\n//      <li class=\"pear\">Pear</li>\n//    </ul>\n```\n\nIf you want to return the outerHTML you can use `$.html(selector)`:\n\n```js\n$.html('.pear')\n//=> <li class=\"pear\">Pear</li>\n```\n\nBy default, `html` will leave some tags open. Sometimes you may instead want to render a valid XML document. For example, you might parse the following XML snippet:\n\n```xml\n$ = cheerio.load('<media:thumbnail url=\"http://www.foo.com/keyframe.jpg\" width=\"75\" height=\"50\" time=\"12:05:01.123\"/>');\n```\n\n... and later want to render to XML. To do this, you can use the 'xml' utility function:\n\n```js\n$.xml()\n//=>  <media:thumbnail url=\"http://www.foo.com/keyframe.jpg\" width=\"75\" height=\"50\" time=\"12:05:01.123\"/>\n```\n\nYou may also render the text content of a Cheerio object using the `text` static method:\n\n```js\n$ = cheerio.load('This is <em>content</em>.')\n$.text()\n//=> This is content.\n```\n\nThe method may be called on the Cheerio module itself--be sure to pass a collection of nodes!\n\n```js\n$ = cheerio.load('<div>This is <em>content</em>.</div>')\ncheerio.text($('div'))\n//=> This is content.\n```\n\n### Miscellaneous\nDOM element methods that don't fit anywhere else\n\n#### .toArray()\nRetrieve all the DOM elements contained in the jQuery set as an array.\n\n```js\n$('li').toArray()\n//=> [ {...}, {...}, {...} ]\n```\n\n#### .clone() ####\nClone the cheerio object.\n\n```js\nvar moreFruit = $('#fruits').clone()\n```\n\n### Utilities\n\n#### $.root\n\nSometimes you need to work with the top-level root element. To query it, you can use `$.root()`.\n\n```js\n$.root().append('<ul id=\"vegetables\"></ul>').html();\n//=> <ul id=\"fruits\">...</ul><ul id=\"vegetables\"></ul>\n```\n\n#### $.contains( container, contained )\nChecks to see if the `contained` DOM element is a descendant of the `container` DOM element.\n\n#### $.parseHTML( data [, context ] [, keepScripts ] )\nParses a string into an array of DOM nodes. The `context` argument has no meaning for Cheerio, but it is maintained for API compatability.\n\n#### $.load( html[, options ] )\nLoad in the HTML. (See the previous section titled \"Loading\" for more information.)\n\n### Plugins\n\nOnce you have loaded a document, you may extend the prototype or the equivalent `fn` property with custom plugin methods:\n\n```js\nvar $ = cheerio.load('<html><body>Hello, <b>world</b>!</body></html>');\n$.prototype.logHtml = function() {\n  console.log(this.html());\n};\n\n$('body').logHtml(); // logs \"Hello, <b>world</b>!\" to the console\n```\n\n### The \"DOM Node\" object\n\nCheerio collections are made up of objects that bear some resemblence to [browser-based DOM nodes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node). You can expect them to define the following properties:\n\n- `tagName`\n- `parentNode`\n- `previousSibling`\n- `nextSibling`\n- `nodeValue`\n- `firstChild`\n- `childNodes`\n- `lastChild`\n\n## What about JSDOM?\nI wrote cheerio because I found myself increasingly frustrated with JSDOM. For me, there were three main sticking points that I kept running into again and again:\n\n__&#8226; JSDOM's built-in parser is too strict:__\n  JSDOM's bundled HTML parser cannot handle many popular sites out there today.\n\n__&#8226; JSDOM is too slow:__\nParsing big websites with JSDOM has a noticeable delay.\n\n__&#8226; JSDOM feels too heavy:__\nThe goal of JSDOM is to provide an identical DOM environment as what we see in the browser. I never really needed all this, I just wanted a simple, familiar way to do HTML manipulation.\n\n## When I would use JSDOM\n\nCheerio will not solve all your problems. I would still use JSDOM if I needed to work in a browser-like environment on the server, particularly if I wanted to automate functional tests.\n\n## Screencasts\n\nhttp://vimeo.com/31950192\n\n> This video tutorial is a follow-up to Nettut's \"How to Scrape Web Pages with Node.js and jQuery\", using cheerio instead of JSDOM + jQuery. This video shows how easy it is to use cheerio and how much faster cheerio is than JSDOM + jQuery.\n\n## Contributors\n\nThese are some of the contributors that have made cheerio possible:\n\n```\nproject  : cheerio\n repo age : 2 years, 6 months\n active   : 285 days\n commits  : 762\n files    : 36\n authors  :\n   293  Matt Mueller            38.5%\n   133  Matthew Mueller         17.5%\n    92  Mike Pennisi            12.1%\n    54  David Chambers          7.1%\n    30  kpdecker                3.9%\n    19  Felix Böhm             2.5%\n    17  fb55                    2.2%\n    15  Siddharth Mahendraker   2.0%\n    11  Adam Bretz              1.4%\n     8  Nazar Leush             1.0%\n     7  ironchefpython          0.9%\n     6  Jarno Leppänen         0.8%\n     5  Ben Sheldon             0.7%\n     5  Jos Shepherd            0.7%\n     5  Ryan Schmukler          0.7%\n     5  Steven Vachon           0.7%\n     4  Maciej Adwent           0.5%\n     4  Amir Abu Shareb         0.5%\n     3  jeremy.dentel@brandingbrand.com 0.4%\n     3  Andi Neck               0.4%\n     2  steve                   0.3%\n     2  alexbardas              0.3%\n     2  finspin                 0.3%\n     2  Ali Farhadi             0.3%\n     2  Chris Khoo              0.3%\n     2  Rob Ashton              0.3%\n     2  Thomas Heymann          0.3%\n     2  Jaro Spisak             0.3%\n     2  Dan Dascalescu          0.3%\n     2  Torstein Thune          0.3%\n     2  Wayne Larsen            0.3%\n     1  Timm Preetz             0.1%\n     1  Xavi                    0.1%\n     1  Alex Shaindlin          0.1%\n     1  mattym                  0.1%\n     1  Felix Böhm            0.1%\n     1  Farid Neshat            0.1%\n     1  Dmitry Mazuro           0.1%\n     1  Jeremy Hubble           0.1%\n     1  nevermind               0.1%\n     1  Manuel Alabor           0.1%\n     1  Matt Liegey             0.1%\n     1  Chris O'Hara            0.1%\n     1  Michael Holroyd         0.1%\n     1  Michiel De Mey          0.1%\n     1  Ben Atkin               0.1%\n     1  Rich Trott              0.1%\n     1  Rob \"Hurricane\" Ashton  0.1%\n     1  Robin Gloster           0.1%\n     1  Simon Boudrias          0.1%\n     1  Sindre Sorhus           0.1%\n     1  xiaohwan                0.1%\n```\n\n## Cheerio in the real world\n\nAre you using cheerio in production? Add it to the [wiki](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio/wiki/Cheerio-in-Production)!\n\n## Testing\n\nTo run the test suite, download the repository, then within the cheerio directory, run:\n\n```shell\nmake setup\nmake test\n```\n\nThis will download the development packages and run the test suite.\n\n## Special Thanks\n\nThis library stands on the shoulders of some incredible developers. A special thanks to:\n\n__&#8226; @FB55 for node-htmlparser2 & CSSSelect:__\nFelix has a knack for writing speedy parsing engines. He completely re-wrote both @tautologistic's `node-htmlparser` and @harry's `node-soupselect` from the ground up, making both of them much faster and more flexible. Cheerio would not be possible without his foundational work\n\n__&#8226; @jQuery team for jQuery:__\nThe core API is the best of its class and despite dealing with all the browser inconsistencies the code base is extremely clean and easy to follow. Much of cheerio's implementation and documentation is from jQuery. Thanks guys.\n\n__&#8226; @visionmedia:__\nThe style, the structure, the open-source\"-ness\" of this library comes from studying TJ's style and using many of his libraries. This dude consistently pumps out high-quality libraries and has always been more than willing to help or answer questions. You rock TJ.\n\n## License\n\nMIT",

This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with\nimplementations like `kqueue` available on most \\*nix platforms. Chokidar still\ndoes have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.\n\nOn other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which\navoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate\nwatchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been\nspecified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much\nmore than needed.\n\n## Getting started\nInstall with npm:\n\n    npm install chokidar --save\n\nThen `require` and use it in your code:\n\n```javascript\nvar chokidar = require('chokidar');\n\n// One-liner for current directory, ignores .dotfiles\nchokidar.watch('.', {ignored: /(^|[\\/\\\\])\\../}).on('all', (event, path) => {\n  console.log(event, path);\n});\n```\n\n```javascript\n// Example of a more typical implementation structure:\n\n// Initialize watcher.\nvar watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, glob, or array', {\n  ignored: /(^|[\\/\\\\])\\../,\n  persistent: true\n});\n\n// Something to use when events are received.\nvar log = console.log.bind(console);\n// Add event listeners.\nwatcher\n  .on('add', path => log(`File ${path} has been added`))\n  .on('change', path => log(`File ${path} has been changed`))\n  .on('unlink', path => log(`File ${path} has been removed`));\n\n// More possible events.\nwatcher\n  .on('addDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))\n  .on('unlinkDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been removed`))\n  .on('error', error => log(`Watcher error: ${error}`))\n  .on('ready', () => log('Initial scan complete. Ready for changes'))\n  .on('raw', (event, path, details) => {\n    log('Raw event info:', event, path, details);\n  });\n\n// 'add', 'addDir' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second\n// argument when available: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats\nwatcher.on('change', (path, stats) => {\n  if (stats) console.log(`File ${path} changed size to ${stats.size}`);\n});\n\n// Watch new files.\nwatcher.add('new-file');\nwatcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3', '**/other-file*']);\n\n// Get list of actual paths being watched on the filesystem\nvar watchedPaths = watcher.getWatched();\n\n// Un-watch some files.\nwatcher.unwatch('new-file*');\n\n// Stop watching.\nwatcher.close();\n\n// Full list of options. See below for descriptions. (do not use this example)\nchokidar.watch('file', {\n  persistent: true,\n\n  ignored: '*.txt',\n  ignoreInitial: false,\n  followSymlinks: true,\n  cwd: '.',\n  disableGlobbing: false,\n\n  usePolling: true,\n  interval: 100,\n  binaryInterval: 300,\n  alwaysStat: false,\n  depth: 99,\n  awaitWriteFinish: {\n    stabilityThreshold: 2000,\n    pollInterval: 100\n  },\n\n  ignorePermissionErrors: false,\n  atomic: true // or a custom 'atomicity delay', in milliseconds (default 100)\n});\n\n```\n\n## API\n\n`chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`\n\n* `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched\nrecursively, or glob patterns.\n* `options` (object) Options object as defined below:\n\n#### Persistence\n\n* `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process\nshould continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to\n`false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted\nafter `ready`, even if the process continues to run.\n\n#### Path filtering\n\n* `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)\nDefines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is\ntested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it\ngets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second\ntime with two arguments (the path and the\n[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)\nobject of that path).\n* `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while\ninstantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event).\n* `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the\nsymlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following\nthe link references and bubbling events through the link's path.\n* `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be\nderived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.\n* `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as\nliteral path names, even if they look like globs.\n\n#### Performance\n\n* `usePolling` (default: `false`).\nWhether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling\nleads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is\ntypically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over\na network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other\nnon-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on OS X overrides the\n`useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable\nto true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.\n* _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)\n  * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling. You may also \n    set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.\n  * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system\n  polling for binary files.\n  ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))\n* `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on OS X). Whether to use the\n`fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly\nand `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When\nset to `false` on OS X, `usePolling: true` becomes the default.\n* `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the\n[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)\nobject that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set\nthis to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't\nalready available from the underlying watch events.\n* `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of\nsubdirectories will be traversed.\n* `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`).\nBy default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before\nthe entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change`\nevents will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,\nespecially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the\nwrite operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.\nSetting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size,\nholding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a\nconfigurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily\ndependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should\nbe relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.\nUse with caution.\n  * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust\n  timing params:*\n  * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in\n  milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.\n  * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval.\n\n#### Errors\n* `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files\nthat don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM`\nor `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently.\n* `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`).\nAutomatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use\n\"atomic writes\" instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is\nre-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event\nrather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well\nfor you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in\nmilliseconds.\n\n### Methods & Events\n\n`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:\n\n* `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.\nTakes an array of strings or just one string.\n* `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.\nAvailable events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`,\n`raw`, `error`.\nAdditionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event\nname and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.\n* `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.\nTakes an array of strings or just one string.\n* `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files.\n* `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file\nsystem being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the\ndirectories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the\nvalues are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.\n\n## CLI\n\nIf you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out\n[chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to\nexecute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.\n\n## Install Troubleshooting\n\n* `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`\n  * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is\n    not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,\n    Chokidar should function properly.\n\n* `ERR! stack Error: Python executable \"python\" is v3.4.1, which is not supported by gyp.`\n  * You should be able to resolve this by installing python 2.7 and running:\n    `npm config set python python2.7`\n\n* `gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make`\n  * On Mac, install the XCode command-line tools\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 Paul Miller (http://paulmillr.com) & Elan Shanker\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Be advised that chokidar will initiate\nwatchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been\nspecified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much\nmore than needed.\n\n## Getting started\nInstall with npm:\n\n    npm install chokidar --save\n\nThen `require` and use it in your code:\n\n```javascript\nvar chokidar = require('chokidar');\n\n// One-liner for current directory, ignores .dotfiles\nchokidar.watch('.', {ignored: /(^|[\\/\\\\])\\../}).on('all', (event, path) => {\n  console.log(event, path);\n});\n```\n\n```javascript\n// Example of a more typical implementation structure:\n\n// Initialize watcher.\nvar watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, glob, or array', {\n  ignored: /(^|[\\/\\\\])\\../,\n  persistent: true\n});\n\n// Something to use when events are received.\nvar log = console.log.bind(console);\n// Add event listeners.\nwatcher\n  .on('add', path => log(`File ${path} has been added`))\n  .on('change', path => log(`File ${path} has been changed`))\n  .on('unlink', path => log(`File ${path} has been removed`));\n\n// More possible events.\nwatcher\n  .on('addDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))\n  .on('unlinkDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been removed`))\n  .on('error', error => log(`Watcher error: ${error}`))\n  .on('ready', () => log('Initial scan complete. Ready for changes'))\n  .on('raw', (event, path, details) => {\n    log('Raw event info:', event, path, details);\n  });\n\n// 'add', 'addDir' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second\n// argument when available: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats\nwatcher.on('change', (path, stats) => {\n  if (stats) console.log(`File ${path} changed size to ${stats.size}`);\n});\n\n// Watch new files.\nwatcher.add('new-file');\nwatcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3', '**/other-file*']);\n\n// Get list of actual paths being watched on the filesystem\nvar watchedPaths = watcher.getWatched();\n\n// Un-watch some files.\nwatcher.unwatch('new-file*');\n\n// Stop watching.\nwatcher.close();\n\n// Full list of options. See below for descriptions. (do not use this example)\nchokidar.watch('file', {\n  persistent: true,\n\n  ignored: '*.txt',\n  ignoreInitial: false,\n  followSymlinks: true,\n  cwd: '.',\n  disableGlobbing: false,\n\n  usePolling: true,\n  interval: 100,\n  binaryInterval: 300,\n  alwaysStat: false,\n  depth: 99,\n  awaitWriteFinish: {\n    stabilityThreshold: 2000,\n    pollInterval: 100\n  },\n\n  ignorePermissionErrors: false,\n  atomic: true // or a custom 'atomicity delay', in milliseconds (default 100)\n});\n\n```\n\n## API\n\n`chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`\n\n* `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched\nrecursively, or glob patterns.\n* `options` (object) Options object as defined below:\n\n#### Persistence\n\n* `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process\nshould continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to\n`false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted\nafter `ready`, even if the process continues to run.\n\n#### Path filtering\n\n* `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)\nDefines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is\ntested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it\ngets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second\ntime with two arguments (the path and the\n[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)\nobject of that path).\n* `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while\ninstantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event).\n* `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the\nsymlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following\nthe link references and bubbling events through the link's path.\n* `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be\nderived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.\n* `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as\nliteral path names, even if they look like globs.\n\n#### Performance\n\n* `usePolling` (default: `false`).\nWhether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling\nleads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is\ntypically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over\na network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other\nnon-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on OS X overrides the\n`useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable\nto true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.\n* _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)\n  * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling. You may also \n    set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.\n  * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system\n  polling for binary files.\n  ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))\n* `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on OS X). Whether to use the\n`fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly\nand `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When\nset to `false` on OS X, `usePolling: true` becomes the default.\n* `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the\n[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)\nobject that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set\nthis to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't\nalready available from the underlying watch events.\n* `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of\nsubdirectories will be traversed.\n* `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`).\nBy default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before\nthe entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change`\nevents will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,\nespecially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the\nwrite operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.\nSetting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size,\nholding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a\nconfigurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily\ndependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should\nbe relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.\nUse with caution.\n  * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust\n  timing params:*\n  * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in\n  milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.\n  * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval.\n\n#### Errors\n* `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files\nthat don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM`\nor `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently.\n* `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`).\nAutomatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use\n\"atomic writes\" instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is\nre-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event\nrather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well\nfor you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in\nmilliseconds.\n\n### Methods & Events\n\n`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:\n\n* `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.\nTakes an array of strings or just one string.\n* `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.\nAvailable events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`,\n`raw`, `error`.\nAdditionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event\nname and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.\n* `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.\nTakes an array of strings or just one string.\n* `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files.\n* `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file\nsystem being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the\ndirectories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the\nvalues are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.\n\n## CLI\n\nIf you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out\n[chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to\nexecute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.\n\n## Install Troubleshooting\n\n* `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`\n  * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is\n    not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,\n    Chokidar should function properly.\n\n* `ERR! stack Error: Python executable \"python\" is v3.4.1, which is not supported by gyp.`\n  * You should be able to resolve this by installing python 2.7 and running:\n    `npm config set python python2.7`\n\n* `gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make`\n  * On Mac, install the XCode command-line tools\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 Paul Miller (http://paulmillr.com) & Elan Shanker\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

For more details about the feature request process see [this document](https://github.com/mgechev/codelyzer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-missing-a-feature)**\n\n[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mgechev/codelyzer/master/assets/ngconf.png)](https://youtu.be/bci-Z6nURgE)\n\n## How to use?\n\n### Angular CLI\n\n[Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io) has support for codelyzer. In order to validate your code with CLI and the custom Angular specific rules just use:\n\n```shell\nng new codelyzer\nng lint\n```\n\nNote that by default all components are aligned with the style guide so you won't see any errors in the console.\n\n### Angular Seed\n\nAnother project which has out of the box integration with codelyzer is [angular-seed](https://github.com/mgechev/angular-seed). In order to run the linter you should:\n\n```shell\n# Skip if you've already cloned Angular Seed\ngit clone https://github.com/mgechev/angular-seed\n\n# Skip if you've already installed all the dependencies of Angular Seed\ncd angular-seed && npm i\n\n# Run all the tslint and codelyzer rules\nnpm run lint\n```\n\nNote that by default all components are aligned with the style guide so you won't see any errors in the console.\n\n### Custom Setup\n\n#### Preset\n\nYou can use the [`tslint-angular`](https://github.com/mgechev/tslint-angular) preset. All you need is:\n\n```shell\nnpm i tslint-angular\n```\n\nAfter that create a `tslint.json` file with the following configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"extends\": [\"tslint-angular\"]\n}\n```\n\nRun the linter with:\n\n```bash\n./node_modules/.bin/tslint -c tslint.json\n```\n\nTSLint will now complain that there are rules which require type checking. In order to fix this, use thw `-p` config option:\n\n```bash\n./node_modules/.bin/tslint -p tsconfig.json -c tslint.json\n```\n\n#### Custom Installation\n\nYou can easily use codelyzer with your custom setup:\n\n```shell\nnpm i codelyzer tslint @angular/compiler @angular/core\n```\n\nA. Using codelyzer package in PATH\n\nCreate the following `tslint.json` file like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"extends\": [\"codelyzer\"],\n  \"rules\": {\n    \"angular-whitespace\": [true, \"check-interpolation\", \"check-semicolon\"],\n    \"banana-in-box\": true,\n    \"templates-no-negated-async\": true,\n    \"directive-selector\": [true, \"attribute\", \"sg\", \"camelCase\"],\n    \"component-selector\": [true, \"element\", \"sg\", \"kebab-case\"],\n    \"max-inline-declarations\": true,\n    \"no-life-cycle-call\": true,\n    \"prefer-output-readonly\": true,\n    \"no-conflicting-life-cycle-hooks\": true,\n    \"enforce-component-selector\": true,\n    \"no-queries-parameter\": true,\n    \"prefer-inline-decorator\": true,\n    \"use-input-property-decorator\": true,\n    \"use-output-property-decorator\": true,\n    \"use-host-property-decorator\": true,\n    \"use-view-encapsulation\": true,\n    \"no-attribute-parameter-decorator\": true,\n    \"no-output-named-after-standard-event\": true,\n    \"no-input-rename\": true,\n    \"no-output-rename\": true,\n    \"no-output-on-prefix\": true,\n    \"no-forward-ref\": true,\n    \"no-unused-css\": true,\n    \"use-life-cycle-interface\": true,\n    \"contextual-life-cycle\": true,\n    \"trackBy-function\": true,\n    \"use-pipe-transform-interface\": true,\n    \"component-class-suffix\": true,\n    \"directive-class-suffix\": true,\n    \"pipe-impure\": true,\n    \"i18n\": [true, \"check-id\", \"check-text\"],\n    \"template-cyclomatic-complexity\": [true, 5],\n    \"template-conditional-complexity\": [true, 4]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo run TSLint with this setup you can use one of the following alternatives:\n\n1.  Install codelyzer globally `npm install -g codelyzer`\n\n2.  Run TSLint from a package.json script by adding a script like `tslint .` to your package.json, similar to:\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  ...\n  \"lint\": \"tslint .\",\n  ...\n},\n```\n\nThen run `npm run lint`\n\nB. Using codelyzer from node_modules directory\n\nNow create the following `tslint.json` file where your `node_modules` directory is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"rulesDirectory\": [\"node_modules/codelyzer\"],\n  \"rules\": {\n    \"angular-whitespace\": [true, \"check-interpolation\", \"check-semicolon\"],\n    \"banana-in-box\": true,\n    \"templates-no-negated-async\": true,\n    \"directive-selector\": [true, \"attribute\", \"sg\", \"camelCase\"],\n    \"component-selector\": [true, \"element\", \"sg\", \"kebab-case\"],\n    \"max-inline-declarations\": true,\n    \"no-life-cycle-call\": true,\n    \"prefer-output-readonly\": true,\n    \"no-conflicting-life-cycle-hooks\": true,\n    \"enforce-component-selector\": true,\n    \"no-queries-parameter\": true,\n    \"prefer-inline-decorator\": true,\n    \"use-input-property-decorator\": true,\n    \"use-output-property-decorator\": true,\n    \"use-host-property-decorator\": true,\n    \"use-view-encapsulation\": true,\n    \"no-attribute-parameter-decorator\": true,\n    \"no-output-named-after-standard-event\": true,\n    \"no-input-rename\": true,\n    \"no-output-rename\": true,\n    \"no-output-on-prefix\": true,\n    \"no-forward-ref\": true,\n    \"no-unused-css\": true,\n    \"use-life-cycle-interface\": true,\n    \"contextual-life-cycle\": true,\n    \"trackBy-function\": true,\n    \"use-pipe-transform-interface\": true,\n    \"component-class-suffix\": true,\n    \"directive-class-suffix\": true,\n    \"pipe-impure\": true,\n    \"i18n\": [true, \"check-id\", \"check-text\"],\n    \"template-cyclomatic-complexity\": [true, 5],\n    \"template-conditional-complexity\": [true, 4]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNext you can create a component file in the same directory with name `component.ts` and the following content:\n\n```ts\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'codelyzer',\n  template: `\n    <h1>Hello {{ name }}!</h1>\n  `\n})\nclass Codelyzer {\n  name: string = 'World';\n\n  ngOnInit() {\n    console.log('Initialized');\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAs last step you can execute all the rules against your code with tslint:\n\n```shell\n./node_modules/.bin/tslint -c tslint.json component.ts\n```\n\nYou should see the following output:\n\n```text\ncomponent.ts[4, 13]: The selector of the component \"Codelyzer\" should have prefix \"sg\" (https://goo.gl/cix8BY)\ncomponent.ts[12, 3]: Implement lifecycle hook interface OnInit for method ngOnInit in class Codelyzer (https://goo.gl/w1Nwk3)\ncomponent.ts[9, 7]: The name of the class Codelyzer should end with the suffix Component (https://goo.gl/5X1TE7)\n```\n\n### Editor Configuration\n\n**Note that you need to have tslint plugin install on your editor**.\n\nCodelyzer should work out of the box with Atom but for VSCode you will have to open `Code > Preferences > User Settings`, and enter the following config:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tslint.rulesDirectory\": \"./node_modules/codelyzer\",\n  \"typescript.tsdk\": \"node_modules/typescript/lib\"\n}\n```\n\nNow you should have the following result:\n\n![VSCode Codelyzer](http://gifyu.com/images/cd.gif)\n\nEnjoy!\n\n## Changelog\n\nYou can find it [here](https://github.com/mgechev/codelyzer/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## Recommended configuration\n\nBelow you can find a recommended configuration which is based on the [Angular Style Guide](https://angular.io/styleguide).\n\n```js\n{\n  // The rule have the following arguments:\n  // [ENABLED,

More information [here](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/usage/rule-flags/).\n\nTo disable rules that validate templates or styles you'd need to add a marker in the TypeScript file referencing them.\n\n```ts\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\n\n/* tslint:disable:trackBy-function */\n@Component({\n  selector: 'codelyzer',\n  templateUrl: './codelyzer.component.html'\n})\nclass Codelyzer {}\n```\n\n## Advanced configuration\n\nCodelyzer supports any template and style language by custom hooks. If you're using Sass for instance, you can allow codelyzer to analyze your styles by creating a file `.codelyzer.js` in the root of your project (where the `node_modules` directory is). In the configuration file can implement custom pre-processing and template resolution logic:\n\n```js\n// Demo of transforming Sass styles\nvar sass = require('node-sass');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  // Definition of custom interpolation strings\n  interpolation: ['{{', '}}'],\n\n  // You can transform the urls of your external styles and templates\n  resolveUrl(url, decorator) {\n    return url;\n  },\n\n  // Transformation of the templates. This hooks is quite useful\n  // if you're using any other templating language, for instance\n  // jade, markdown, haml, etc.\n  //\n  // NOTE that this method WILL NOT throw an error in case of invalid template.\n  //\n  transformTemplate(code, url, decorator) {\n    return { code: code, url: url };\n  },\n\n  // Transformation of styles. This hook is useful is you're using\n  // any other style language, for instance Sass, Less, etc.\n  //\n  // NOTE that this method WILL NOT throw an error in case of invalid style.\n  //\n  transformStyle(code, url, decorator) {\n    var result = { code: code, url: url };\n    if (url && /\\.scss$/.test(url)) {\n      var transformed = sass.renderSync({ data: code, sourceMap: true, outFile: '/dev/null' });\n      result.source = code;\n      result.code = transformed.css.toString();\n      result.map = transformed.map.toString();\n    }\n    return result;\n  },\n\n  // Custom predefined directives in case you get error for\n  // missing property and you are using a template reference\n  predefinedDirectives: [{ selector: 'form', exportAs: 'ngForm' }],\n\n  // None = 0b000, Error = 0b001, Info = 0b011, Debug = 0b111\n  logLevel: 0b111\n};\n```\n\n## Contributors\n\n| [<img alt=\"mgechev\" src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/455023?v=4&s=117\"

Digestable with JSON!\n\n| HTML | JSON | GLSL AST | JS AST (Esprima) |\n|------|------|----------|------------------------|\n| [cssauron-html](http://npm.im/cssauron-html) | [cssauron-json](http://npm.im/cssauron-json) | [cssauron-glsl](http://npm.im/cssauron-glsl) | [cssauron-falafel](http://npm.im/cssauron-falafel) |\n\n\n# API\n\n### require('cssauron')(options) -> selector factory\n\nImport `cssauron` and configure it for the nested object structure you'll\nwant to match against.\n\n#### options\n\n`options` are an object hash of lookup type to string attribute or `function(node)` lookups for queried\nnodes. You only need to provide the configuration necessary for the selectors you're planning on creating.\n(If you're not going to use `#id` lookups, there's no need to provide the `id` lookup in your options.)\n\n* `tag`: Extract tag information from a node for `div` style selectors.\n* `contents`: Extract text information from a node, for `:contains(xxx)` selectors.\n* `id`: Extract id for `#my_sweet_id` selectors.\n* `class`: `.class_name`\n* `parent`: Used to traverse up from the current node, for composite selectors `body #wrapper`, `body > #wrapper`.\n* `children`: Used to traverse from a parent to its children for sibling selectors `div + span`, `a ~ p`.\n* `attr`: Used to extract attribute information, for `[attr=thing]` style selectors.\n\n### selector_factory('some selector') -> match function\n\nCompiles a matching function.\n\n### match(node) -> false | node | [subjects, ...]\n\nReturns false if the provided node does not match the selector. Returns truthy if the provided\nnode *does* match. Exact return value is determined by the selector, based on\nthe [CSS4 subject selector spec](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/selectors4/#subject): if only\na single node is matched, only that node is returned. If multiple subjects are matched,\na deduplicated array of those subjects are returned.\n\nFor example, given the following HTML (and `cssauron-html`):\n\n```html\n<div id=\"gary-busey\">\n    <p>\n        <span class=\"jake-busey\">\n        </span>\n    </p>\n</div>\n```\n\nChecking the following selectors against the `span.jake-busey` element yields:\n\n - `#gary-busey`: `false`, no match.\n - `#gary-busey *`: `span.jake-busey`, a single match.\n - `!#gary-busey *`: `div#gary-busey`, a single match using the `!` subject selector.\n - `#gary-busey *, p span`: `span.jake-busey`, a single match, though both selectors match.\n - `#gary-busey !* !*, !p > !span`: `[p, span.jake-busey]`, two matches.\n\n## Supported pseudoclasses \n\n - `:first-child`\n - `:last-child`\n - `:nth-child`\n - `:empty`\n - `:root`\n - `:contains(text)`\n - `:any(selector, selector, selector)`\n\n## Supported attribute lookups\n\n - `[attr=value]`: Exact match\n - `[attr]`: Attribute exists and is not false-y.\n - `[attr$=value]`: Attribute ends with value\n - `[attr^=value]`: Attribute starts with value\n - `[attr*=value]`: Attribute contains value\n - `[attr~=value]`: Attribute, split by whitespace, contains value.\n - `[attr|=value]`: Attribute, split by `-`, contains value.",

So say we wanted to expose a `get(url)` function that did\nand HTTP request and returned the response body.\n\nThe user has provided us with this implementation:\n\n``` js\nfunction myFn () {\n  var one = get('https://google.com');\n  var two = get('http://nodejs.org');\n  var three = JSON.parse(get('http://jsonip.org'));\n  return [one, two, three];\n}\n```\n\nNow we can compile this into an asyncronous generator function, implement the\nasync `get()` function, and finally evaluate it into a real JavaScript function\ninstance with the `vm` module:\n\n\n``` js\nvar co = require('co');\nvar vm = require('vm');\nvar degenerator = require('degenerator');\n\n// the `get()` function is thunk-based (error handling omitted for brevity)\nfunction get (endpoint) {\n  return function (fn) {\n    var mod = 0 == endpoint.indexOf('https:') ? require('https') : require('http');\n    var req = mod.get(endpoint);\n    req.on('response', function (res) {\n      var data = '';\n      res.setEncoding('utf8');\n      res.on('data', function (b) { data += b; });\n      res.on('end', function () {\n        fn(null, data);\n      });\n    });\n  };\n}\n\n// convert the JavaScript string provided from the user (assumed to be `str` var)\nstr = degenerator(str, [ 'get' ]);\n\n// at this stage, you could use a transpiler like `facebook/regenerator`\n// here if desired.\n\n// turn the JS String into a real GeneratorFunction instance\nvar genFn = vm.runInNewContext('(' + str + ')', { get: get });\n\n// use a generator-based flow control library (`visionmedia/co`, `jmar777/suspend`,\n// etc.) to create an async function from the generator function.\n\nvar asnycFn = co(genFn);\n\n// NOW USE IT!!!\nasyncFn(function (err, res) {\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\n\nAPI\n---\n\n### degenerator(String jsStr, Array functionNames) → String\n\nReturns a \"degeneratorified\" JavaScript string, with ES6 Generator\nfunctions transplanted.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.",

This is so that you may use any ES6 standard Promise compliant library - or, of course, native ES6 Promises.\n\nIf you're running the code on a browser or node version that doesn't include native promises you will need to include a polyfill.  The following polyfills are tested as part of this module's test suite:-\n- [Jake Archibald](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake)'s [ES6 Promise library](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) (which is actually adapted from [Stefan Penner](https://twitter.com/stefanpenner)'s [RSVP.js](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js)). -  `require('es6-promise').polyfill();`\n- [Getify](https://twitter.com/getify)'s [Native Promise Only library](https://github.com/getify/native-promise-only) - `require('native-promise-only');`\n- [ES6 Shim](https://github.com/es-shims/es6-shim) - `require('es6-shim');`\n- [Calvin Metcalf](https://twitter.com/CWMma)'s [Lie](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/lie) - `global.Promise = global.Promise || require('lie');`\n\nNote: as of v1.2.0 you can use **denodeify** in the front end.  Pull it in via CommonJS, AMD or simply add to your webpage and it'll be available on `window.denodeify`. \n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install denodeify --save\n```\n\nOr:-\n\n```\nbower install denodeify --save\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nSimple example with [`readFile`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/read-file):-\n\n```js\nrequire('es6-promise').polyfill();\n\nvar denodeify = require('denodeify');\nvar readFile = denodeify(require('fs').readFile);\n\nreadFile('my-file.txt', { encoding: 'UTF-8' })\n  .then(function(text) {\n    console.log(\"My file's contents is: \" + text);\n  });\n```\n\n(Note: you will need to also install [es6-promise](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) with `npm install es6-promise` for this code sample to work within node versions that don't have `Promise` natively available)\n\nMore complex example with `exec`:-\n\n## Advanced usage\n\nYou can also pass in a function as a second argument of `denodeify` that allows you to manipulate the data returned by the wrapped function before it gets passed to the Promise's `reject` or `resolve` functions, for example:-\n\n```js\nrequire('es6-promise').polyfill();\n\nvar denodeify = require('denodeify');\nvar exec = denodeify(require('child_process').exec, function(err, stdout, stderr) {\n\n  // Throw away stderr data\n  return [err, stdout];\n});\n\nexec('hostname')\n  .then(function(host) {\n    console.log(\"My hostname is: \" + host.replace('\\n', ''));\n  });\n```\n\nOr,\n\n```js\nrequire('es6-promise').polyfill();\n\nvar denodeify = require('denodeify');\nvar exec = denodeify(require('child_process').exec, function(err, stdout, stderr) {\n  return [err, [stdout, stderr]];\n});\n\nexec('my-command')\n  .then(function(results) {\n    console.log(\"stdout is: \" + results[0]);\n    console.log(\"stderr is: \" + results[1]);\n  });\n```\n\nUseful for functions that return multiple arguments, for example [`child_process#exec`](http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback).\n\n## Credits and collaboration ##\n\nThe lead developer of **denodeify** is [Matt Andrews](http://twitter.com/andrewsmatt) at FT Labs with much help and support from [Kornel Lesiński](https://twitter.com/pornelski). All open source code released by FT Labs is licenced under the MIT licence. We welcome comments, feedback and suggestions.  Please feel free to raise an issue or pull request.",

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

It's highly configurable.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* plugin system\r\n* provide a custom filesystem\r\n* sync and async node.js filesystems included\r\n\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n### Install\r\n```sh\r\n# npm\r\nnpm install enhanced-resolve\r\n# or Yarn\r\nyarn add enhanced-resolve\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Creating a Resolver\r\nThe easiest way to create a resolver is to use the `createResolver` function on `ResolveFactory`, along with one of the supplied File System implementations.\r\n```js\r\nconst {\r\n  NodeJsInputFileSystem,\r\n  CachedInputFileSystem,\r\n  ResolverFactory\r\n} = require('enhanced-resolve');\r\n\r\n// create a resolver\r\nconst myResolver = ResolverFactory.createResolver({\r\n  // Typical usage will consume the `NodeJsInputFileSystem` + `CachedInputFileSystem`, which wraps the Node.js `fs` wrapper to add resilience + caching.\r\n  fileSystem: new CachedInputFileSystem(new NodeJsInputFileSystem(), 4000),\r\n  extensions: ['.js', '.json']\r\n  /* any other resolver options here.

These plugins can extend the functionality of the library, adding other ways for files/contexts to be resolved.\r\n\r\nA plugin should be a `class` (or its ES5 equivalent) with an `apply` method. The `apply` method will receive a `resolver` instance, that can be used to hook in to the event system.\r\n\r\n### Plugin Boilerplate\r\n```js\r\nclass MyResolverPlugin {\r\n  constructor(source, target) {\r\n    this.source = source;\r\n    this.target = target;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  apply(resolver) {\r\n    resolver.plugin(this.source, (request, callback) => {\r\n      // Any logic you need to create a new `request` can go here\r\n      resolver.doResolve(this.target, request, null, callback);\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlugins are executed in a pipeline, and register which event they should be executed before/after. In the example above, `source` is the name of the event that starts the pipeline, and `target` is what event this plugin should fire, which is what continues the execution of the pipeline. For an example of how these different plugin events create a chain, see `lib/ResolverFactory.js`, in the `//// pipeline ////` section.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\nnpm test\r\n```\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/webpack/enhanced-resolve.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/webpack/enhanced-resolve)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Passing options from webpack\r\nIf you are using `webpack`, and you want to pass custom options to `enhanced-resolve`, the options are passed from the `resolve` key of your webpack configuration e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\nresolve: {\r\n  extensions: ['', '.js', '.jsx'],\r\n  modules: ['src', 'node_modules'],\r\n  plugins: [new DirectoryNamedWebpackPlugin()]\r\n  ...\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012-2016 Tobias Koppers\r\n\r\nMIT (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)",

Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.\n\n**By errno:**\n\n```js\nrequire('errno').errno[3]\n// → {\n//     \"errno\": 3,\n//     \"code\": \"EACCES\",\n//     \"description\": \"permission denied\"\n//   }\n```\n\n**By code:**\n\n```js\nrequire('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY\n// → {\n//     \"errno\": 53,\n//     \"code\": \"ENOTEMPTY\",\n//     \"description\": \"directory not empty\"\n//   }\n```\n\n**Make your errors more descriptive:**\n\n```js\nvar errno = require('errno')\n\nfunction errmsg(err) {\n  var str = 'Error: '\n  // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno\n  if (errno.errno[err.errno])\n    str += errno.errno[err.errno].description\n  else\n    str += err.message\n\n  // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property\n  if (err.path)\n    str += ' [' + err.path + ']'\n\n  return str\n}\n\nvar fs = require('fs')\n\nfs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {\n  if (err)\n    console.log(errmsg(err))\n})\n```\n\n**Use as a command line tool:**\n\n```\n~ $ errno 53\n{\n  \"errno\": 53,\n  \"code\": \"ENOTEMPTY\",\n  \"description\": \"directory not empty\"\n}\n~ $ errno EROFS\n{\n  \"errno\": 56,\n  \"code\": \"EROFS\",\n  \"description\": \"read-only file system\"\n}\n~ $ errno foo\nNo such errno/code: \"foo\"\n```\n\nSupply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.\n\nYou will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.\n\n<a name=\"customerrors\"></a>\n## Custom errors\n\nUse `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.\n\n```js\nvar create = require('errno').custom.createError\nvar MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error\nvar SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError\nvar OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)\n\n// use them!\nif (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')\n\nif (err) return callback(new OtherError(err))\n```\n\nAlso available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:\n\n```js\nfs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {\n  if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))\n  // do something else\n})\n```\n\nThe resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.\n\n## Contributors\n\n* [bahamas10](https://github.com/bahamas10) (Dave Eddy) - Added CLI\n* [ralphtheninja](https://github.com/ralphtheninja) (Lars-Magnus Skog)\n\n## Copyright & Licence\n\n*Copyright (c) 2012-2015 [Rod Vagg](https://github.com/rvagg) ([@rvagg](https://twitter.com/rvagg))*\n\nMade available under the MIT licence:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished\nto do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        fallback: 'iteration'\n    }\n);\n```\n\nIf the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes.\nPlease note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        fallback: function (node) {\n            return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {\n                return key !== 'argument'\n            });\n        }\n    }\n);\n```\n\n### License\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 [Yusuke Suzuki](https://github.com/Constellation)\n (twitter: [@Constellation](https://twitter.com/Constellation)) and other contributors.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n  * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n    documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nARE DISCLAIMED.

It provides classes for easily building\nWebSocket servers and clients in Node. It does not provide a server itself, but\nrather makes it easy to handle WebSocket connections within an existing\n[Node](http://nodejs.org/) application. It does not provide any abstraction\nother than the standard [WebSocket API](http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/).\n\nIt also provides an abstraction for handling\n[EventSource](http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/) connections, which are\none-way connections that allow the server to push data to the client. They are\nbased on streaming HTTP responses and can be easier to access via proxies than\nWebSockets.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n$ npm install faye-websocket\n```\n\n\n## Handling WebSocket connections in Node\n\nYou can handle WebSockets on the server side by listening for HTTP Upgrade\nrequests, and creating a new socket for the request. This socket object exposes\nthe usual WebSocket methods for receiving and sending messages. For example this\nis how you'd implement an echo server:\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),\n    http      = require('http');\n\nvar server = http.createServer();\n\nserver.on('upgrade', function(request, socket, body) {\n  if (WebSocket.isWebSocket(request)) {\n    var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body);\n    \n    ws.on('message', function(event) {\n      ws.send(event.data);\n    });\n    \n    ws.on('close', function(event) {\n      console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);\n      ws = null;\n    });\n  }\n});\n\nserver.listen(8000);\n```\n\n`WebSocket` objects are also duplex streams, so you could replace the\n`ws.on('message', ...)` line with:\n\n```js\n    ws.pipe(ws);\n```\n\nNote that under certain circumstances (notably a draft-76 client connecting\nthrough an HTTP proxy), the WebSocket handshake will not be complete after you\ncall `new WebSocket()` because the server will not have received the entire\nhandshake from the client yet. In this case, calls to `ws.send()` will buffer\nthe message in memory until the handshake is complete, at which point any\nbuffered messages will be sent to the client.\n\nIf you need to detect when the WebSocket handshake is complete, you can use the\n`onopen` event.\n\nIf the connection's protocol version supports it, you can call `ws.ping()` to\nsend a ping message and wait for the client's response. This method takes a\nmessage string, and an optional callback that fires when a matching pong message\nis received. It returns `true` if and only if a ping message was sent. If the\nclient does not support ping/pong, this method sends no data and returns\n`false`.\n\n```js\nws.ping('Mic check, one, two', function() {\n  // fires when pong is received\n});\n```\n\n\n## Using the WebSocket client\n\nThe client supports both the plain-text `ws` protocol and the encrypted `wss`\nprotocol, and has exactly the same interface as a socket you would use in a web\nbrowser. On the wire it identifies itself as `hybi-13`.\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),\n    ws        = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/');\n\nws.on('open', function(event) {\n  console.log('open');\n  ws.send('Hello, world!');\n});\n\nws.on('message', function(event) {\n  console.log('message', event.data);\n});\n\nws.on('close', function(event) {\n  console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);\n  ws = null;\n});\n```\n\nThe WebSocket client also lets you inspect the status and headers of the\nhandshake response via its `statusCode` and `headers` properties.\n\nTo connect via a proxy, set the `proxy` option to the HTTP origin of the proxy,\nincluding any authorization information, custom headers and TLS config you\nrequire. Only the `origin` setting is required.\n\n```js\nvar ws = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/', [], {\n  proxy: {\n    origin:  'http://username:password@proxy.example.com',\n    headers: {'User-Agent': 'node'},\n    tls:     {cert: fs.readFileSync('client.crt')}\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThe `tls` value is a Node 'TLS options' object that will be passed to\n[`tls.connect()`](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback).\n\n\n## Subprotocol negotiation\n\nThe WebSocket protocol allows peers to select and identify the application\nprotocol to use over the connection. On the client side, you can set which\nprotocols the client accepts by passing a list of protocol names when you\nconstruct the socket:\n\n```js\nvar ws = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/', ['irc', 'amqp']);\n```\n\nOn the server side, you can likewise pass in the list of protocols the server\nsupports after the other constructor arguments:\n\n```js\nvar ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, ['irc', 'amqp']);\n```\n\nIf the client and server agree on a protocol, both the client- and server-side\nsocket objects expose the selected protocol through the `ws.protocol` property.\n\n\n## Protocol extensions\n\nfaye-websocket is based on the\n[websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)\nframework that allows extensions to be negotiated via the\n`Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header. To add extensions to a connection, pass an\narray of extensions to the `:extensions` option. For example, to add\n[permessage-deflate](https://github.com/faye/permessage-deflate-node):\n\n```js\nvar deflate = require('permessage-deflate');\n\nvar ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, [], {extensions: [deflate]});\n```\n\n\n## Initialization options\n\nBoth the server- and client-side classes allow an options object to be passed in\nat initialization time, for example:\n\n```js\nvar ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, protocols, options);\nvar ws = new WebSocket.Client(url, protocols, options);\n```\n\n`protocols` is an array of subprotocols as described above, or `null`.\n`options` is an optional object containing any of these fields:\n\n* `extensions` - an array of\n  [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)\n  compatible extensions, as described above\n* `headers` - an object containing key-value pairs representing HTTP headers to\n  be sent during the handshake process\n* `maxLength` - the maximum allowed size of incoming message frames, in bytes.\n  The default value is `2^26 - 1`, or 1 byte short of 64 MiB.\n* `ping` - an integer that sets how often the WebSocket should send ping frames,\n  measured in seconds\n\nThe client accepts some additional options:\n\n* `proxy` - settings for a proxy as described above\n* `tls` - a Node 'TLS options' object containing TLS settings for the origin\n  server, this will be passed to\n  [`tls.connect()`](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback)\n* `ca` - (legacy) a shorthand for passing `{tls: {ca: value}}`\n\n\n## WebSocket API\n\nBoth server- and client-side `WebSocket` objects support the following API.\n\n* <b>`on('open', function(event) {})`</b> fires when the socket connection is\n  established. Event has no attributes.\n* <b>`on('message', function(event) {})`</b> fires when the socket receives a\n  message. Event has one attribute, <b>`data`</b>, which is either a `String`\n  (for text frames) or a `Buffer` (for binary frames).\n* <b>`on('error', function(event) {})`</b> fires when there is a protocol error\n  due to bad data sent by the other peer. This event is purely informational,\n  you do not need to implement error recover.\n* <b>`on('close', function(event) {})`</b> fires when either the client or the\n  server closes the connection. Event has two optional attributes, <b>`code`</b>\n  and <b>`reason`</b>, that expose the status code and message sent by the peer\n  that closed the connection.\n* <b>`send(message)`</b> accepts either a `String` or a `Buffer` and sends a\n  text or binary message over the connection to the other peer.\n* <b>`ping(message, function() {})`</b> sends a ping frame with an optional\n  message and fires the callback when a matching pong is received.\n* <b>`close(code, reason)`</b> closes the connection, sending the given status\n  code and reason text, both of which are optional.\n* <b>`version`</b> is a string containing the version of the `WebSocket`\n  protocol the connection is using.\n* <b>`protocol`</b> is a string (which may be empty) identifying the subprotocol\n  the socket is using.\n\n\n## Handling EventSource connections in Node\n\nEventSource connections provide a very similar interface, although because they\nonly allow the server to send data to the client, there is no `onmessage` API.\nEventSource allows the server to push text messages to the client, where each\nmessage has an optional event-type and ID.\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket   = require('faye-websocket'),\n    EventSource = WebSocket.EventSource,\n    http        = require('http');\n\nvar server = http.createServer();\n\nserver.on('request', function(request, response) {\n  if (EventSource.isEventSource(request)) {\n    var es = new EventSource(request, response);\n    console.log('open', es.url, es.lastEventId);\n    \n    // Periodically send messages\n    var loop = setInterval(function() { es.send('Hello') }, 1000);\n    \n    es.on('close', function() {\n      clearInterval(loop);\n      es = null;\n    });\n  \n  } else {\n    // Normal HTTP request\n    response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});\n    response.end('Hello');\n  }\n});\n\nserver.listen(8000);\n```\n\nThe `send` method takes two optional parameters, `event` and `id`. The default\nevent-type is `'message'` with no ID. For example, to send a `notification`\nevent with ID `99`:\n\n```js\nes.send('Breaking News!', {event: 'notification', id: '99'});\n```\n\nThe `EventSource` object exposes the following properties:\n\n* <b>`url`</b> is a string containing the URL the client used to create the\n  EventSource.\n* <b>`lastEventId`</b> is a string containing the last event ID received by the\n  client. You can use this when the client reconnects after a dropped connection\n  to determine which messages need resending.\n\nWhen you initialize an EventSource with ` new EventSource()`, you can pass\nconfiguration options after the `response` parameter. Available options are:\n\n* <b>`headers`</b> is an object containing custom headers to be set on the\n  EventSource response.\n* <b>`retry`</b> is a number that tells the client how long (in seconds) it\n  should wait after a dropped connection before attempting to reconnect.\n* <b>`ping`</b> is a number that tells the server how often (in seconds) to send\n  'ping' packets to the client to keep the connection open, to defeat timeouts\n  set by proxies. The client will ignore these messages.\n\nFor example, this creates a connection that allows access from any origin, pings\nevery 15 seconds and is retryable every 10 seconds if the connection is broken:\n\n```js\nvar es = new EventSource(request, response, {\n  headers: {'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'},\n  ping:    15,\n  retry:   10\n});\n```\n\nYou can send a ping message at any time by calling `es.ping()`. Unlike\nWebSocket, the client does not send a response to this; it is merely to send\nsome data over the wire to keep the connection alive.\n\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2010-2015 James Coglan\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Event has one attribute, <b>`data`</b>, which is either a `String`\n  (for text frames) or a `Buffer` (for binary frames).\n* <b>`on('error', function(event) {})`</b> fires when there is a protocol error\n  due to bad data sent by the other peer. This event is purely informational,\n  you do not need to implement error recover.\n* <b>`on('close', function(event) {})`</b> fires when either the client or the\n  server closes the connection. Event has two optional attributes, <b>`code`</b>\n  and <b>`reason`</b>, that expose the status code and message sent by the peer\n  that closed the connection.\n* <b>`send(message)`</b> accepts either a `String` or a `Buffer` and sends a\n  text or binary message over the connection to the other peer.\n* <b>`ping(message, function() {})`</b> sends a ping frame with an optional\n  message and fires the callback when a matching pong is received.\n* <b>`close(code, reason)`</b> closes the connection, sending the given status\n  code and reason text, both of which are optional.\n* <b>`version`</b> is a string containing the version of the `WebSocket`\n  protocol the connection is using.\n* <b>`protocol`</b> is a string (which may be empty) identifying the subprotocol\n  the socket is using.\n\n\n## Handling EventSource connections in Node\n\nEventSource connections provide a very similar interface, although because they\nonly allow the server to send data to the client, there is no `onmessage` API.\nEventSource allows the server to push text messages to the client, where each\nmessage has an optional event-type and ID.\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket   = require('faye-websocket'),\n    EventSource = WebSocket.EventSource,\n    http        = require('http');\n\nvar server = http.createServer();\n\nserver.on('request', function(request, response) {\n  if (EventSource.isEventSource(request)) {\n    var es = new EventSource(request, response);\n    console.log('open', es.url, es.lastEventId);\n    \n    // Periodically send messages\n    var loop = setInterval(function() { es.send('Hello') }, 1000);\n    \n    es.on('close', function() {\n      clearInterval(loop);\n      es = null;\n    });\n  \n  } else {\n    // Normal HTTP request\n    response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});\n    response.end('Hello');\n  }\n});\n\nserver.listen(8000);\n```\n\nThe `send` method takes two optional parameters, `event` and `id`. The default\nevent-type is `'message'` with no ID. For example, to send a `notification`\nevent with ID `99`:\n\n```js\nes.send('Breaking News!', {event: 'notification', id: '99'});\n```\n\nThe `EventSource` object exposes the following properties:\n\n* <b>`url`</b> is a string containing the URL the client used to create the\n  EventSource.\n* <b>`lastEventId`</b> is a string containing the last event ID received by the\n  client. You can use this when the client reconnects after a dropped connection\n  to determine which messages need resending.\n\nWhen you initialize an EventSource with ` new EventSource()`, you can pass\nconfiguration options after the `response` parameter. Available options are:\n\n* <b>`headers`</b> is an object containing custom headers to be set on the\n  EventSource response.\n* <b>`retry`</b> is a number that tells the client how long (in seconds) it\n  should wait after a dropped connection before attempting to reconnect.\n* <b>`ping`</b> is a number that tells the server how often (in seconds) to send\n  'ping' packets to the client to keep the connection open, to defeat timeouts\n  set by proxies. The client will ignore these messages.\n\nFor example, this creates a connection that allows access from any origin, pings\nevery 15 seconds and is retryable every 10 seconds if the connection is broken:\n\n```js\nvar es = new EventSource(request, response, {\n  headers: {'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'},\n  ping:    15,\n  retry:   10\n});\n```\n\nYou can send a ping message at any time by calling `es.ping()`. Unlike\nWebSocket, the client does not send a response to this; it is merely to send\nsome data over the wire to keep the connection alive.\n\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2010-2017 James Coglan\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Example value: `{ http: new http.Agent(), https: new https.Agent() }`\n\n\n## Browserify Usage\n\nDue to the way `XMLHttpRequest` works, the `browserify` versions of `http` and `https` already follow redirects.\n If you are *only* targeting the browser, then this library has little value for you. If you want to write cross\n platform code for node and the browser, `follow-redirects` provides a great solution for making the native node\n modules behave the same as they do in browserified builds in the browser. To avoid bundling unnecessary code\n you should tell browserify to swap out `follow-redirects` with the standard modules when bundling.\n To make this easier, you need to change how you require the modules:\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require('follow-redirects/http');\nvar https = require('follow-redirects/https');\n```\n\nYou can then replace `follow-redirects` in your browserify configuration like so:\n\n```javascript\n\"browser\": {\n  \"follow-redirects/http\"  : \"http\",\n  \"follow-redirects/https\" : \"https\"\n}\n```\n\nThe `browserify-http` module has not kept pace with node development, and no long behaves identically to the native\n module when running in the browser. If you are experiencing problems, you may want to check out\n [browserify-http-2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-browserify-2). It is more actively maintained and\n attempts to address a few of the shortcomings of `browserify-http`. In that case, your browserify config should\n look something like this:\n\n```javascript\n\"browser\": {\n  \"follow-redirects/http\"  : \"browserify-http-2/http\",\n  \"follow-redirects/https\" : \"browserify-http-2/https\"\n}\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nPull Requests are always welcome. Please [file an issue](https://github.com/olalonde/follow-redirects/issues)\n detailing your proposal before you invest your valuable time. Additional features and bug fixes should be accompanied\n by tests. You can run the test suite locally with a simple `npm test` command.\n\n## Debug Logging\n\n`follow-redirects` uses the excellent [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) for logging. To turn on logging\n set the environment variable `DEBUG=follow-redirects` for debug output from just this module. When running the test\n suite it is sometimes advantageous to set `DEBUG=*` to see output from the express server as well.\n\n## Authors\n\n- Olivier Lalonde (olalonde@gmail.com)\n- James Talmage (james@talmage.io)\n- [Ruben Verborgh](https://ruben.verborgh.org/)\n\n## License\n\nMIT: [http://olalonde.mit-license.org](http://olalonde.mit-license.org)",

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\n\nYou must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\nYou must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and\n\nYou must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\n\nIf the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS",

There is built-in support for a variety of \"protocols\", and it's\neasily extensible with more:\n\n| Protocol  | Description                     | Example\n|:---------:|:-------------------------------:|:---------------------------------:\n| `data`    | [Data URIs][data]               | `data:text/plain;base64,SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ%3D%3D`\n| `file`    | [File URIs][file]               | `file:///c:/windows/example.ini`\n| `ftp`     | [FTP URIs][ftp]                 | `ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/site/README`\n| `http`    | [HTTP URIs][http]               | `http://www.example.com/path/to/name`\n| `https`   | [HTTPS URIs][https]             | `https://www.example.com/path/to/name`\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install get-uri\n```\n\n\nExample\n-------\n\nTo simply get a `stream.Readable` instance from a `file:` URI, try something like:\n\n``` js\nvar getUri = require('get-uri');\n\n// `file:` maps to a `fs.ReadStream` instance…\ngetUri('file:///Users/nrajlich/wat.json', function (err, rs) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n  rs.pipe(process.stdout);\n});\n```\n\n\nMissing Endpoints\n-----------------\n\nWhen you pass in a URI in which the resource referenced does not exist on the\ndestination server, then a `NotFoundError` will be returned. The `code` of the\nerror instance is set to `\"ENOTFOUND\"`, so you can special-case that in your code\nto detect when a bad filename is requested:\n\n``` js\ngetUri('http://example.com/resource.json', function (err, rs) {\n  if (err) {\n    if ('ENOTFOUND' == err.code) {\n      // bad file path requested\n    } else {\n      // something else bad happened...\n      throw err;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // your app code…\n});\n```\n\n\nCacheability\n------------\n\nWhen calling `getUri()` with the same URI multiple times, the `get-uri` module\nsupports sending an indicator that the remote resource has not been modified\nsince the last time it has been retreived from that node process.\n\nTo do this, pass in a `cache` option to the \"options object\" argument\nwith the value set to the `stream.Readable` instance that was previously\nreturned. If the remote resource has not been changed since the last call for\nthat same URI, then a `NotModifiedError` instance will be returned with it's\n`code` property set to `\"ENOTMODIFIED\"`.\n\nWhen the `\"ENOTMODIFIED\"` error occurs, then you can safely re-use the\nresults from the previous `getUri()` call for that same URI:\n\n``` js\n// maps to a `fs.ReadStream` instance\ngetUri('http://example.com/resource.json', function (err, rs) {\n  if (err) throw err;\n\n  // … some time later, if you need to get this same URI again, pass in the\n  // previous `stream.Readable` instance as `cache` option to potentially\n  // receive an \"ENOTMODIFIED\" response:\n  var opts = { cache: rs };\n  getUri('http://example.com/resource.json', opts, function (err, rs2) {\n    if (err) {\n      if ('ENOTFOUND' == err.code) {\n        // bad file path requested\n      } else if ('ENOTMODIFIED' == err.code) {\n        // source file has not been modified since last time it was requested,\n        // so `rs2` is undefined and you are expected to re-use results from\n        // a previous call to `getUri()`\n      } else {\n        // something else bad happened...\n        throw err;\n      }\n    }\n  });\n});\n```\n\n\nAPI\n---\n\n### getUri(String uri[, Object options,] Function callback)\n\nA `uri` String is required. An optional `options` object may be passed in:\n\n - `cache` - A `stream.Readable` instance from a previous call to `getUri()` with the same URI. If this option is passed in, and the destination endpoint has not been modified, then an `ENOTMODIFIED` error is returned\n\nAny other options passed in to the `options` object will be passed through\nto the low-level connection creation functions (`http.get()`, `ftp.connect()`,\netc).\n\nInvokes the given `callback` function with a `stream.Readable` instance to\nread the resource at the given `uri`.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[data]: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2397\n[file]: http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hoffman-file-uri-03\n[ftp]: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc959/\n[http]: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html\n[https]: http://wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure",

Required.\n  * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.\n  * `secureProxy` - Boolean - If `true`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy. Defaults to `false`.\n  * `secureEndpoint` - Boolean - If `true` then a TLS connection to the endpoint will be established on top of the proxy socket.

To filter filenames according to .gitignore file, I recommend this module.\n\n##### Tested on\n\n- Linux + Node: `0.8` - `7.x`\n- Windows + Node: `0.10` - `7.x`, node < `0.10` is not tested due to the lack of support of appveyor.\n\nActually, `ignore` does not rely on any versions of node specially.\n\n## Table Of Main Contents\n\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [Guide for 2.x -> 3.x](#upgrade-2x---3x)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- Related Packages\n  - [`glob-gitignore`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob-gitignore) matches files using patterns and filters them according to gitignore rules.\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst ignore = require('ignore')\nconst ig = ignore().add(['.abc/*', '!.abc/d/'])\n```\n\n### Filter the given paths\n\n```js\nconst paths = [\n  '.abc/a.js',    // filtered out\n  '.abc/d/e.js'   // included\n]\n\nig.filter(paths)        // ['.abc/d/e.js']\nig.ignores('.abc/a.js') // true\n```\n\n### As the filter function\n\n```js\npaths.filter(ig.createFilter()); // ['.abc/d/e.js']\n```\n\n### Win32 paths will be handled\n\n```js\nig.filter(['.abc\\\\a.js', '.abc\\\\d\\\\e.js'])\n// if the code above runs on windows, the result will be\n// ['.abc\\\\d\\\\e.js']\n```\n\n## Why another ignore?\n\n- `ignore` is a standalone module, and is much simpler so that it could easy work with other programs, unlike [isaacs](https://npmjs.org/~isaacs)'s [fstream-ignore](https://npmjs.org/package/fstream-ignore) which must work with the modules of the fstream family.\n\n- `ignore` only contains utility methods to filter paths according to the specified ignore rules, so\n  - `ignore` never try to find out ignore rules by traversing directories or fetching from git configurations.\n  - `ignore` don't cares about sub-modules of git projects.\n\n- Exactly according to [gitignore man page](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore), fixes some known matching issues of fstream-ignore, such as:\n  - '`/*.js`' should only match '`a.js`', but not '`abc/a.js`'.\n  - '`**/foo`' should match '`foo`' anywhere.\n  - Prevent re-including a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded.\n  - Handle trailing whitespaces:\n    - `'a '`(one space) should not match `'a  '`(two spaces).\n    - `'a \\ '` matches `'a  '`\n  - All test cases are verified with the result of `git check-ignore`.\n\n## Methods\n\n### .add(pattern)\n### .add(patterns)\n\n- **pattern** `String|Ignore` An ignore pattern string, or the `Ignore` instance\n- **patterns** `Array.<pattern>` Array of ignore patterns.\n\nAdds a rule or several rules to the current manager.\n\nReturns `this`\n\nNotice that a line starting with `'#'`(hash) is treated as a comment. Put a backslash (`'\\'`) in front of the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash, if you want to ignore a file with a hash at the beginning of the filename.\n\n```js\nignore().add('#abc').ignores('#abc')    // false\nignore().add('\\#abc').ignores('#abc')   // true\n```\n\n`pattern` could either be a line of ignore pattern or a string of multiple ignore patterns, which means we could just `ignore().add()` the content of a ignore file:\n\n```js\nignore()\n.add(fs.readFileSync(filenameOfGitignore).toString())\n.filter(filenames)\n```\n\n`pattern` could also be an `ignore` instance, so that we could easily inherit the rules of another `Ignore` instance.\n\n### <strike>.addIgnoreFile(path)</strike>\n\nREMOVED in `3.x` for now.\n\nTo upgrade `ignore@2.x` up to `3.x`, use\n\n```js\nconst fs = require('fs')\n\nif (fs.existsSync(filename)) {\n  ignore().add(fs.readFileSync(filename).toString())\n}\n```\n\ninstead.\n\n\n### .ignores(pathname)\n\n> new in 3.2.0\n\nReturns `Boolean` whether `pathname` should be ignored.\n\n```js\nig.ignores('.abc/a.js')    // true\n```\n\n### .filter(paths)\n\nFilters the given array of pathnames, and returns the filtered array.\n\n- **paths** `Array.<path>` The array of `pathname`s to be filtered.\n\n**NOTICE** that:\n\n- `pathname` should be a string that have been `path.join()`ed, or the return value of `path.relative()` to the current directory.\n\n```js\n// WRONG\nig.ignores('./abc')\n\n// WRONG, for it will never happen.\n// If the gitignore rule locates at the root directory,\n// `'/abc'` should be changed to `'abc'`.\n// ```\n// path.relative('/', '/abc')  -> 'abc'\n// ```\nig.ignores('/abc')\n\n// Right\nig.ignores('abc')\n\n// Right\nig.ignores(path.join('./abc'))  // path.join('./abc') -> 'abc'\n```\n\n- In other words, each `pathname` here should be a relative path to the directory of the git ignore rules.\n\nSuppose the dir structure is:\n\n```\n/path/to/your/repo\n    |-- a\n    |   |-- a.js\n    |\n    |-- .b\n    |\n    |-- .c\n         |-- .DS_store\n```\n\nThen the `paths` might be like this:\n\n```js\n[\n  'a/a.js'\n  '.b',\n  '.c/.DS_store'\n]\n```\n\nUsually, you could use [`glob`](http://npmjs.org/package/glob) with `option.mark = true` to fetch the structure of the current directory:\n\n```js\nconst glob = require('glob')\n\nglob('**', {\n  // Adds a / character to directory matches.\n  mark: true\n}, (err, files) => {\n  if (err) {\n    return console.error(err)\n  }\n\n  let filtered = ignore().add(patterns).filter(files)\n  console.log(filtered)\n})\n```\n\n### .createFilter()\n\nCreates a filter function which could filter an array of paths with `Array.prototype.filter`.\n\nReturns `function(path)` the filter function.\n\n****\n\n## Upgrade 2.x -> 3.x\n\n- All `options` of 2.x are unnecessary and removed, so just remove them.\n- `ignore()` instance is no longer an [`EventEmitter`](nodejs.org/api/events.html), and all events are unnecessary and removed.\n- `.addIgnoreFile()` is removed, see the [.addIgnoreFile](#addignorefilepath) section for details.\n\n****\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe code of `node-ignore` is based on es6 and babel, but babel and its preset is not included in the `dependencies` field of package.json, so that the installation process of test cases will not fail in older versions of node.\n\nSo use `bash install.sh` to install dependencies and `bash test.sh` to run test cases in your local machine.\n\n#### Collaborators\n\n- [SamyPesse](https://github.com/SamyPesse) *Samy Pessé*\n- [azproduction](https://github.com/azproduction) *Mikhail Davydov*\n- [TrySound](https://github.com/TrySound) *Bogdan Chadkin*\n- [JanMattner](https://github.com/JanMattner) *Jan Mattner*",

    "licenseText": "iMurmurHash.js\n==============\n\nAn incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).\n\nThis version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\n\n```bash\nnpm install imurmurhash\n```\n\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\n\n```javascript\nMurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');\n```\n\nQuick Example\n-------------\n\n```javascript\n// Create the initial hash\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3('string');\n\n// Incrementally add text\nhashState.hash('more strings');\nhashState.hash('even more strings');\n\n// All calls can be chained if desired\nhashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');\n\n// Get a result\nhashState.result();\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\n```\n\nFunctions\n---------\n\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same\n// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)\nhashState = MurmurHash3();\n...\n\n// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the\n// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss\n// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.\nhashState = new MurmurHash3();\n```\n\nBoth methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)\nIncrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()\nGet the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.\n\n```javascript\n// Do the whole string at once\nMurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();\n// 0x70529328\n\n// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part\nvar m = MurmurHash3('this is a');\nm.result();\n// 0xbfc4f834\nm.hash(' test string').result();\n// 0x70529328 (same as above)\n```\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])\nReset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\nLicense (MIT)\n-------------\nCopyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

    "licenseText": "# ipaddr.js — an IPv6 and IPv4 address manipulation library [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/whitequark/ipaddr.js.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/whitequark/ipaddr.js)\n\nipaddr.js is a small (1.9K minified and gzipped) library for manipulating\nIP addresses in JavaScript environments. It runs on both CommonJS runtimes\n(e.g. [nodejs]) and in a web browser.\n\nipaddr.js allows you to verify and parse string representation of an IP\naddress, match it against a CIDR range or range list, determine if it falls\ninto some reserved ranges (examples include loopback and private ranges),\nand convert between IPv4 and IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.\n\n[nodejs]: http://nodejs.org\n\n## Installation\n\n`npm install ipaddr.js`\n\nor\n\n`bower install ipaddr.js`\n\n## API\n\nipaddr.js defines one object in the global scope: `ipaddr`. In CommonJS,\nit is exported from the module:\n\n```js\nvar ipaddr = require('ipaddr.js');\n```\n\nThe API consists of several global methods and two classes: ipaddr.IPv6 and ipaddr.IPv4.\n\n### Global methods\n\nThere are three global methods defined: `ipaddr.isValid`, `ipaddr.parse` and\n`ipaddr.process`. All of them receive a string as a single parameter.\n\nThe `ipaddr.isValid` method returns `true` if the address is a valid IPv4 or\nIPv6 address, and `false` otherwise. It does not throw any exceptions.\n\nThe `ipaddr.parse` method returns an object representing the IP address,\nor throws an `Error` if the passed string is not a valid representation of an\nIP address.\n\nThe `ipaddr.process` method works just like the `ipaddr.parse` one, but it\nautomatically converts IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses to their IPv4 counterparts\nbefore returning. It is useful when you have a Node.js instance listening\non an IPv6 socket, and the `net.ivp6.bindv6only` sysctl parameter (or its\nequivalent on non-Linux OS) is set to 0. In this case, you can accept IPv4\nconnections on your IPv6-only socket, but the remote address will be mangled.\nUse `ipaddr.process` method to automatically demangle it.\n\n### Object representation\n\nParsing methods return an object which descends from `ipaddr.IPv6` or\n`ipaddr.IPv4`. These objects share some properties, but most of them differ.\n\n#### Shared properties\n\nOne can determine the type of address by calling `addr.kind()`. It will return\neither `\"ipv6\"` or `\"ipv4\"`.\n\nAn address can be converted back to its string representation with `addr.toString()`.\nNote that this method:\n * does not return the original string used to create the object (in fact, there is\n   no way of getting that string)\n * returns a compact representation (when it is applicable)\n\nA `match(range, bits)` method can be used to check if the address falls into a\ncertain CIDR range.\nNote that an address can be (obviously) matched only against an address of the same type.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\nvar addr = ipaddr.parse(\"2001:db8:1234::1\");\nvar range = ipaddr.parse(\"2001:db8::\");\n\naddr.match(range, 32); // => true\n```\n\nAlternatively, `match` can also be called as `match([range, bits])`. In this way,\nit can be used together with the `parseCIDR(string)` method, which parses an IP\naddress together with a CIDR range.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\nvar addr = ipaddr.parse(\"2001:db8:1234::1\");\n\naddr.match(ipaddr.parseCIDR(\"2001:db8::/32\")); // => true\n```\n\nA `range()` method returns one of predefined names for several special ranges defined\nby IP protocols. The exact names (and their respective CIDR ranges) can be looked up\nin the source: [IPv6 ranges] and [IPv4 ranges]. Some common ones include `\"unicast\"`\n(the default one) and `\"reserved\"`.\n\nYou can match against your own range list by using\n`ipaddr.subnetMatch(address, rangeList, defaultName)` method. It can work with a mix of IPv6 or IPv4 addresses, and accepts a name-to-subnet map as the range list. For example:\n\n```js\nvar rangeList = {\n  documentationOnly: [ ipaddr.parse('2001:db8::'), 32 ],\n  tunnelProviders: [\n    [ ipaddr.parse('2001:470::'), 32 ], // he.net\n    [ ipaddr.parse('2001:5c0::'), 32 ]  // freenet6\n  ]\n};\nipaddr.subnetMatch(ipaddr.parse('2001:470:8:66::1'), rangeList, 'unknown'); // => \"tunnelProviders\"\n```\n\nThe addresses can be converted to their byte representation with `toByteArray()`.\n(Actually, JavaScript mostly does not know about byte buffers. They are emulated with\narrays of numbers, each in range of 0..255.)\n\n```js\nvar bytes = ipaddr.parse('2a00:1450:8007::68').toByteArray(); // ipv6.google.com\nbytes // => [42, 0x00, 0x14, 0x50, 0x80, 0x07, 0x00, <zeroes...>, 0x00, 0x68 ]\n```\n\nThe `ipaddr.IPv4` and `ipaddr.IPv6` objects have some methods defined, too. All of them\nhave the same interface for both protocols, and are similar to global methods.\n\n`ipaddr.IPvX.isValid(string)` can be used to check if the string is a valid address\nfor particular protocol, and `ipaddr.IPvX.parse(string)` is the error-throwing parser.\n\n`ipaddr.IPvX.isValid(string)` uses the same format for parsing as the POSIX `inet_ntoa` function, which accepts unusual formats like `0xc0.168.1.1` or `0x10000000`. The function `ipaddr.IPv4.isValidFourPartDecimal(string)` validates the IPv4 address and also ensures that it is written in four-part decimal format.\n\n[IPv6 ranges]: https://github.com/whitequark/ipaddr.js/blob/master/src/ipaddr.coffee#L186\n[IPv4 ranges]: https://github.com/whitequark/ipaddr.js/blob/master/src/ipaddr.coffee#L71\n\n#### IPv6 properties\n\nSometimes you will want to convert IPv6 not to a compact string representation (with\nthe `::` substitution); the `toNormalizedString()` method will return an address where\nall zeroes are explicit.\n\nFor example:\n\n```js\nvar addr = ipaddr.parse(\"2001:0db8::0001\");\naddr.toString(); // => \"2001:db8::1\"\naddr.toNormalizedString(); // => \"2001:db8:0:0:0:0:0:1\"\n```\n\nThe `isIPv4MappedAddress()` method will return `true` if this address is an IPv4-mapped\none, and `toIPv4Address()` will return an IPv4 object address.\n\nTo access the underlying binary representation of the address, use `addr.parts`.\n\n```js\nvar addr = ipaddr.parse(\"2001:db8:10::1234:DEAD\");\naddr.parts // => [0x2001, 0xdb8, 0x10, 0, 0, 0, 0x1234, 0xdead]\n```\n\nA IPv6 zone index can be accessed via `addr.zoneId`:\n\n```js\nvar addr = ipaddr.parse(\"2001:db8::%eth0\");\naddr.zoneId // => 'eth0'\n```\n\n#### IPv4 properties\n\n`toIPv4MappedAddress()` will return a corresponding IPv4-mapped IPv6 address.\n\nTo access the underlying representation of the address, use `addr.octets`.\n\n```js\nvar addr = ipaddr.parse(\"192.168.1.1\");\naddr.octets // => [192, 168, 1, 1]\n```\n\n`prefixLengthFromSubnetMask()` will return a CIDR prefix length for a valid IPv4 netmask or\nfalse if the netmask is not valid.\n\n```js\nipaddr.IPv4.parse('255.255.255.240').prefixLengthFromSubnetMask() == 28\nipaddr.IPv4.parse('255.192.164.0').prefixLengthFromSubnetMask()  == null\n```\n\n`subnetMaskFromPrefixLength()` will return an IPv4 netmask for a valid CIDR prefix length.\n\n```js\nipaddr.IPv4.subnetMaskFromPrefixLength(24) == \"255.255.255.0\"\nipaddr.IPv4.subnetMaskFromPrefixLength(29) == \"255.255.255.248\"\n```\n\n`broadcastAddressFromCIDR()` will return the broadcast address for a given IPv4 interface and netmask in CIDR notation.\n```js\nipaddr.IPv4.broadcastAddressFromCIDR(\"172.0.0.1/24\") == \"172.0.0.255\"\n```\n`networkAddressFromCIDR()` will return the network address for a given IPv4 interface and netmask in CIDR notation.\n```js\nipaddr.IPv4.networkAddressFromCIDR(\"172.0.0.1/24\") == \"172.0.0.0\"\n```\n\n#### Conversion\n\nIPv4 and IPv6 can be converted bidirectionally to and from network byte order (MSB) byte arrays.\n\nThe `fromByteArray()` method will take an array and create an appropriate IPv4 or IPv6 object\nif the input satisfies the requirements. For IPv4 it has to be an array of four 8-bit values,\nwhile for IPv6 it has to be an array of sixteen 8-bit values.\n\nFor example:\n```js\nvar addr = ipaddr.fromByteArray([0x7f, 0, 0, 1]);\naddr.toString(); // => \"127.0.0.1\"\n```\n\nor\n\n```js\nvar addr = ipaddr.fromByteArray([0x20, 1, 0xd, 0xb8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1])\naddr.toString(); // => \"2001:db8::1\"\n```\n\nBoth objects also offer a `toByteArray()` method, which returns an array in network byte order (MSB).\n\nFor example:\n```js\nvar addr = ipaddr.parse(\"127.0.0.1\");\naddr.toByteArray(); // => [0x7f, 0, 0, 1]\n```\n\nor\n\n```js\nvar addr = ipaddr.parse(\"2001:db8::1\");\naddr.toByteArray(); // => [0x20, 1, 0xd, 0xb8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n```",

It does not rely on browsers, DOM, or any JavaScript framework. Thus it's suited for websites, [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) projects, or anywhere that JavaScript can run.\n\nDocumentation & guides live here: [http://jasmine.github.io](http://jasmine.github.io/)\nFor a quick start guide of Jasmine 2.x, see the beginning of [http://jasmine.github.io/edge/introduction.html](http://jasmine.github.io/edge/introduction.html)\n\nUpgrading from Jasmine 1.x?

This plugin uses [`source-map-support`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map-support) to improve the situation.\n\n## Use\n\nInstall the plugin with `npm`:\n\n    npm install karma-source-map-support\n\nConfigure Karma to load the plugin as a framework:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function(config) {\n  config.set({\n    frameworks: ['source-map-support']\n    // additional settings here ...\n  });\n};\n```\n\n## Example\n\nThe config settings below are a complete example using Mocha and Browserify with source map support:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function(config) {\n  config.set({\n    frameworks: ['browserify', 'source-map-support', 'mocha'],\n    files: [\n      'src/**/*.test.js'\n    ],\n    preprocessors: {\n      'src/**/*.test.js': ['browserify']\n    },\n    browsers: ['PhantomJS'],\n    singleRun: false,\n    browserify: {\n      debug: true // include inline source maps\n    }\n  });\n};\n```\n\nSample stack trace without this plugin:\n```\nAssertionError: case 2: expected [ 0, 0.6666666666666666 ] to deeply equal [ 0, 0.5 ]\n    at Function.assert.deepEqual (http://localhost:9876/absolute/var/folders/6m/3grlt52x7w3047wy0n6j7dr00000gn/T/2d4c510ad9122153a42db199d1cc8e9553208184.browserify:1848:32)\n    at Context.<anonymous> (http://localhost:9876/absolute/var/folders/6m/3grlt52x7w3047wy0n6j7dr00000gn/T/2d4c510ad9122153a42db199d1cc8e9553208184.browserify:6061:14)\n    at callFn (http://localhost:9876/base/node_modules/mocha/mocha.js:4496:21)\n    at Test.Runnable.run (http://localhost:9876/base/node_modules/mocha/mocha.js:4489:7)\n    at Runner.runTest (http://localhost:9876/base/node_modules/mocha/mocha.js:4892:10)\n    at http://localhost:9876/base/node_modules/mocha/mocha.js:4970:12\n    at next (http://localhost:9876/base/node_modules/mocha/mocha.js:4817:14)\n    at http://localhost:9876/base/node_modules/mocha/mocha.js:4827:7\n    at next (http://localhost:9876/base/node_modules/mocha/mocha.js:4766:23)\n    at http://localhost:9876/base/node_modules/mocha/mocha.js:4794:5\n```\n\n\nSample stack trace with this plugin:\n```\nAssertionError: case 2: expected [ 0, 0.6666666666666666 ] to deeply equal [ 0, 0.5 ]\n    at Function.assert.deepEqual (node_modules/chai/lib/chai/interface/assert.js:205:1)\n    at Context.<anonymous> (src/scenes/util/geom.test.js:27:1)\n    at callFn (http://localhost:9876/base/node_modules/mocha/mocha.js:4496:21)\n    at Test.Runnable.run (http://localhost:9876/base/node_modules/mocha/mocha.js:4489:7)\n    at Runner.runTest (http://localhost:9876/base/node_modules/mocha/mocha.js:4892:10)\n    at http://localhost:9876/base/node_modules/mocha/mocha.js:4970:12\n    at next (http://localhost:9876/base/node_modules/mocha/mocha.js:4817:14)\n    at http://localhost:9876/base/node_modules/mocha/mocha.js:4827:7\n    at next (http://localhost:9876/base/node_modules/mocha/mocha.js:4766:23)\n    at http://localhost:9876/base/node_modules/mocha/mocha.js:4794:5\n```",

Use it for hacking your HTML/JavaScript/CSS files, but not for deploying the final site.\n\nThere are two reasons for using this:\n\n1. AJAX requests don't work with the `file://` protocol due to security restrictions, i.e. you need a server if your site fetches content through JavaScript.\n2. Having the page reload automatically after changes to files can accelerate development.\n\nYou don't need to install any browser plugins or manually add code snippets to your pages for the reload functionality to work, see \"How it works\" section below for more information. If you don't want/need the live reload, you should probably use something even simpler, like the following Python-based one-liner:\n\n\tpython -m SimpleHTTPServer\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou need node.js and npm. You should probably install this globally.\n\n**Npm way**\n\n\tnpm install -g live-server\n\n**Manual way**\n\n\tgit clone https://github.com/tapio/live-server\n\tcd live-server\n\tnpm install # Local dependencies if you want to hack\n\tnpm install -g # Install globally\n\n\nUsage from command line\n-----------------------\n\nIssue the command `live-server` in your project's directory. Alternatively you can add the path to serve as a command line parameter.\n\nThis will automatically launch the default browser. When you make a change to any file, the browser will reload the page - unless it was a CSS file in which case the changes are applied without a reload.\n\nCommand line parameters:\n\n* `--port=NUMBER` - select port to use, default: PORT env var or 8080\n* `--host=ADDRESS` - select host address to bind to, default: IP env var or 0.0.0.0 (\"any address\")\n* `--no-browser` - suppress automatic web browser launching\n* `--browser=BROWSER` - specify browser to use instead of system default\n* `--quiet | -q` - suppress logging\n* `--verbose | -V` - more logging (logs all requests, shows all listening IPv4 interfaces, etc.)\n* `--open=PATH` - launch browser to PATH instead of server root\n* `--watch=PATH` - comma-separated string of paths to exclusively watch for changes (default: watch everything)\n* `--ignore=PATH` - comma-separated string of paths to ignore ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)\n* `--ignorePattern=RGXP` - Regular expression of files to ignore (ie `.*\\.jade`) (**DEPRECATED** in favor of `--ignore`)\n* `--no-css-inject` - reload page on CSS change, rather than injecting changed CSS\n* `--middleware=PATH` - path to .js file exporting a middleware function to add; can be a name without path nor extension to reference bundled middlewares in `middleware` folder\n* `--entry-file=PATH` - serve this file (server root relative) in place of missing files (useful for single page apps)\n* `--mount=ROUTE:PATH` - serve the paths contents under the defined route (multiple definitions possible)\n* `--spa` - translate requests from /abc to /#/abc (handy for Single Page Apps)\n* `--wait=MILLISECONDS` - (default 100ms) wait for all changes, before reloading\n* `--htpasswd=PATH` - Enables http-auth expecting htpasswd file located at PATH\n* `--cors` - Enables CORS for any origin (reflects request origin, requests with credentials are supported)\n* `--https=PATH` - PATH to a HTTPS configuration module\n* `--https-module=MODULE_NAME` - Custom HTTPS module (e.g. `spdy`)\n* `--proxy=ROUTE:URL` - proxy all requests for ROUTE to URL\n* `--help | -h` - display terse usage hint and exit\n* `--version | -v` - display version and exit\n\nDefault options:\n\nIf a file `~/.live-server.json` exists it will be loaded and used as default options for live-server on the command line. See \"Usage from node\" for option names.\n\n\nUsage from node\n---------------\n\n```javascript\nvar liveServer = require(\"live-server\");\n\nvar params = {\n\tport: 8181, // Set the server port. Defaults to 8080.\n\thost: \"0.0.0.0\", // Set the address to bind to. Defaults to 0.0.0.0 or process.env.IP.\n\troot: \"/public\", // Set root directory that's being served.

See [this question](https://http2.github.io/faq/#does-http2-require-encryption) and [can I use page on HTTP/2](http://caniuse.com/#search=http2) for more details.\n\nFor example from CLI(bash):\n\n\tlive-server \\\n\t\t--https=path/to/https.conf.js \\\n\t\t--https-module=spdy \\\n\t\tmy-app-folder/\n\nTroubleshooting\n---------------\n\n* No reload on changes\n\t* Open your browser's console: there should be a message at the top stating that live reload is enabled. Note that you will need a browser that supports WebSockets. If there are errors, deal with them. If it's still not working, [file an issue](https://github.com/tapio/live-server/issues).\n* Error: watch <PATH> ENOSPC\n\t* See [this suggested solution](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22475849/node-js-error-enospc/32600959#32600959).\n* Reload works but changes are missing or outdated\n\t* Try using `--wait=MS` option. Where `MS` is time in milliseconds to wait before issuing a reload.\n\nHow it works\n------------\n\nThe server is a simple node app that serves the working directory and its subdirectories. It also watches the files for changes and when that happens, it sends a message through a web socket connection to the browser instructing it to reload. In order for the client side to support this, the server injects a small piece of JavaScript code to each requested html file. This script establishes the web socket connection and listens to the reload requests. CSS files can be refreshed without a full page reload by finding the referenced stylesheets from the DOM and tricking the browser to fetch and parse them again.\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nWe welcome contributions!

You want to make some light modifications to it - replacing a few characters here and there, wrapping it with a header and footer, etc - and ideally you'd like to generate a source map at the end of it. You've thought about using something like [recast](https://github.com/benjamn/recast) (which allows you to generate an AST from some JavaScript, manipulate it, and reprint it with a sourcemap without losing your comments and formatting), but it seems like overkill for your needs (or maybe the source code isn't JavaScript).\n\nYour requirements are, frankly, rather niche. But they're requirements that I also have, and for which I made magic-string. It's a small, fast utility for manipulating strings and generating sourcemaps.\n\n## Installation\n\nmagic-string works in both node.js and browser environments. For node, install with npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm i magic-string\n```\n\nTo use in browser, grab the [magic-string.umd.js](https://unpkg.com/magic-string/dist/magic-string.umd.js) file and add it to your page:\n\n```html\n<script src='magic-string.umd.js'></script>\n```\n\n(It also works with various module systems, if you prefer that sort of thing - it has a dependency on [vlq](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/vlq).)\n\n## Usage\n\nThese examples assume you're in node.js, or something similar:\n\n```js\nvar MagicString = require( 'magic-string' );\nvar s = new MagicString( 'problems = 99' );\n\ns.overwrite( 0, 8, 'answer' );\ns.toString(); // 'answer = 99'\n\ns.overwrite( 11, 13, '42' ); // character indices always refer to the original string\ns.toString(); // 'answer = 42'\n\ns.prepend( 'var ' ).append( ';' ); // most methods are chainable\ns.toString(); // 'var answer = 42;'\n\nvar map = s.generateMap({\n  source: 'source.js',\n  file: 'converted.js.map',\n  includeContent: true\n}); // generates a v3 sourcemap\n\nrequire( 'fs' ).writeFile( 'converted.js', s.toString() );\nrequire( 'fs' ).writeFile( 'converted.js.map', map.toString() );\n```\n\nYou can pass an options argument:\n\n```js\nvar s = new MagicString( someCode, {\n  // both these options will be used if you later\n  // call `bundle.addSource( s )` - see below\n  filename: 'foo.js',\n  indentExclusionRanges: [/*...*/]\n});\n```\n\n## Methods\n\n### s.addSourcemapLocation( index )\n\nAdds the specified character index (with respect to the original string) to sourcemap mappings, if `hires` is `false` (see below).\n\n### s.append( content )\n\nAppends the specified content to the end of the string. Returns `this`.\n\n### s.appendLeft( index, content )\n\nAppends the specified `content` at the `index` in the original string. If a range *ending* with `index` is subsequently moved, the insert will be moved with it. Returns `this`. See also `s.prependLeft(...)`.\n\n### s.appendRight( index, content )\n\nAppends the specified `content` at the `index` in the original string. If a range *starting* with `index` is subsequently moved, the insert will be moved with it. Returns `this`. See also `s.prependRight(...)`.\n\n### s.clone()\n\nDoes what you'd expect.\n\n### s.generateMap( options )\n\nGenerates a [version 3 sourcemap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit). All options are, well, optional:\n\n* `file` - the filename where you plan to write the sourcemap\n* `source` - the filename of the file containing the original source\n* `includeContent` - whether to include the original content in the map's `sourcesContent` array\n* `hires` - whether the mapping should be high-resolution. Hi-res mappings map every single character, meaning (for example) your devtools will always be able to pinpoint the exact location of function calls and so on. With lo-res mappings, devtools may only be able to identify the correct line - but they're quicker to generate and less bulky. If sourcemap locations have been specified with `s.addSourceMapLocation()`, they will be used here.\n\nThe returned sourcemap has two (non-enumerable) methods attached for convenience:\n\n* `toString` - returns the equivalent of `JSON.stringify(map)`\n* `toUrl` - returns a DataURI containing the sourcemap. Useful for doing this sort of thing:\n\n```js\ncode += '\\n//# sourceMappingURL=' + map.toUrl();\n```\n\n### s.indent( prefix[, options] )\n\nPrefixes each line of the string with `prefix`. If `prefix` is not supplied, the indentation will be guessed from the original content, falling back to a single tab character. Returns `this`.\n\nThe `options` argument can have an `exclude` property, which is an array of `[start, end]` character ranges. These ranges will be excluded from the indentation - useful for (e.g.) multiline strings.\n\n### s.insertLeft( index, content )\n\n**DEPRECATED** since 0.17 – use `s.appendLeft(...)` instead\n\n### s.insertRight( index, content )\n\n**DEPRECATED** since 0.17 – use `s.prependRight(...)` instead\n\n### s.locate( index )\n\n**DEPRECATED** since 0.10 – see [#30](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/magic-string/pull/30)\n\n### s.locateOrigin( index )\n\n**DEPRECATED** since 0.10 – see [#30](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/magic-string/pull/30)\n\n### s.move( start, end, newIndex )\n\nMoves the characters from `start` and `end` to `index`. Returns `this`.\n\n### s.overwrite( start, end, content[, options] )\n\nReplaces the characters from `start` to `end` with `content`. The same restrictions as `s.remove()` apply. Returns `this`.\n\nThe fourth argument is optional. It can have a `storeName` property — if `true`, the original name will be stored for later inclusion in a sourcemap's `names` array — and a `contentOnly` property which determines whether only the content is overwritten, or anything that was appended/prepended to the range as well.\n\n### s.prepend( content )\n\nPrepends the string with the specified content. Returns `this`.\n\n### s.prependLeft ( index, content )\n\nSame as `s.appendLeft(...)`, except that the inserted content will go *before* any previous appends or prepends at `index`\n\n### s.prependRight ( index, content )\n\nSame as `s.appendRight(...)`, except that the inserted content will go *before* any previous appends or prepends at `index`\n\n### s.remove( start, end )\n\nRemoves the characters from `start` to `end` (of the original string, **not** the generated string). Removing the same content twice, or making removals that partially overlap, will cause an error. Returns `this`.\n\n### s.slice( start, end )\n\nReturns the content of the generated string that corresponds to the slice between `start` and `end` of the original string. Throws error if the indices are for characters that were already removed.\n\n### s.snip( start, end )\n\nReturns a clone of `s`, with all content before the `start` and `end` characters of the original string removed.\n\n### s.toString()\n\nReturns the generated string.\n\n### s.trim([ charType ])\n\nTrims content matching `charType` (defaults to `\\s`, i.e. whitespace) from the start and end. Returns `this`.\n\n### s.trimStart([ charType ])\n\nTrims content matching `charType` (defaults to `\\s`, i.e. whitespace) from the start. Returns `this`.\n\n### s.trimEnd([ charType ])\n\nTrims content matching `charType` (defaults to `\\s`, i.e. whitespace) from the end. Returns `this`.\n\n### s.trimLines()\n\nRemoves empty lines from the start and end. Returns `this`.\n\n## Bundling\n\nTo concatenate several sources, use `MagicString.Bundle`:\n\n```js\nvar bundle = new MagicString.Bundle();\n\nbundle.addSource({\n  filename: 'foo.js',\n  content: new MagicString( 'var answer = 42;' )\n});\n\nbundle.addSource({\n  filename: 'bar.js',\n  content: new MagicString( 'console.log( answer )' )\n});\n\n// Advanced: a source can include an `indentExclusionRanges` property\n// alongside `filename` and `content`. This will be passed to `s.indent()`\n// - see documentation above\n\nbundle.indent() // optionally, pass an indent string, otherwise it will be guessed\n  .prepend( '(function () {\\n' )\n  .append( '}());' );\n\nbundle.toString();\n// (function () {\n//   var answer = 42;\n//   console.log( answer );\n// }());\n\n// options are as per `s.generateMap()` above\nvar map = bundle.generateMap({\n  file: 'bundle.js',\n  includeContent: true,\n  hires: true\n});\n```\n\nAs an alternative syntax, if you a) don't have `filename` or `indentExclusionRanges` options, or b) passed those in when you used `new MagicString(...)`, you can simply pass the `MagicString` instance itself:\n\n```js\nvar bundle = new MagicString.Bundle();\nvar source = new MagicString( someCode, {\n  filename: 'foo.js'\n});\n\nbundle.addSource( source );\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT",

This module is highly inspired by Perl [Net::Netmask](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-Netmask/) module.\n\nSynopsis\n--------\n\n    var Netmask = require('netmask').Netmask\n\n    var block = new Netmask('10.0.0.0/12');\n    block.base;                     // 10.0.0.0\n    block.mask;                     // 255.240.0.0\n    block.bitmask;                  // 12\n    block.hostmask;                 // 0.15.255.255\n    block.broadcast;                // 10.15.255.255\n    block.size;                     // 1048576\n    block.first;                    // 10.0.0.1\n    block.last;                     // 10.15.255.254\n\n    block.contains('10.0.8.10');    // true\n    block.contains('10.8.0.10');    // true\n    block.contains('192.168.1.20'); // false\n\n    block.forEach(function(ip, long, index));\n\n    block.next()                    // Netmask('10.16.0.0/12')\n\nConstructing\n------------\n\nNetmask objects are created with an IP address and optionally a mask. There are many forms that are recognized:\n\n    '216.240.32.0/24'               // The preferred form.\n    '216.240.32.0/255.255.255.0'\n    '216.240.32.0', '255.255.255.0'\n    '216.240.32.0', 0xffffff00\n    '216.240.32.4'                  // A /32 block.\n    '216.240.32'                    // A /24 block.\n    '216.240'                       // A /16 block.\n    '140'                           // A /8 block.\n    '216.240.32/24'\n    '216.240/16'\n\nAPI\n---\n\n- `.base`: The base address of the network block as a string (eg: 216.240.32.0). Base does not give an indication of the size of the network block.\n- `.mask`: The netmask as a string (eg: 255.255.255.0).\n- `.hostmask`: The host mask which is the opposite of the netmask (eg: 0.0.0.255).\n- `.bitmask`: The netmask as a number of bits in the network portion of the address for this block (eg: 24).\n- `.size`: The number of IP addresses in a block (eg: 256).\n- `.broadcast`: The blocks broadcast address (eg: 192.168.1.0/24 => 192.168.1.255)\n- `.first`, `.last`: First and last useable address\n- `.contains(ip or block)`: Returns a true if the IP number `ip` is part of the network. That is, a true value is returned if `ip` is between `base` and `broadcast`. If a Netmask object or a block is given, it returns true only of the given block fits inside the network.\n- `.forEach(fn)`: Similar to the Array prototype method. It loops through all the useable addresses, ie between `first` and `last`.\n- `.next(count)`: Without a `count`, return the next block of the same size after the current one. With a count, return the Nth block after the current one. A count of -1 returns the previous block.

[Angular-seed](https://github.com/mgechev/angular-seed) and [Quickstart](https://github.com/angular/quickstart) are my favorite seeds and [Angular-Cli](https://cli.angular.io/) and [Ionic v2](https://ionicframework.com/) are my favorite generators, but you can use any one for your project.\r\n\r\nA running example on how to use this library can be found at [AngularShowcase](http://github.com/AngularShowcase/angular2-seed-ng2-highcharts) or [here](http://github.com/Bigous/angular2-seed-ng2-highcharts).\r\n\r\nMore examples and detailed information on how to use the library, follow the [wiki](https://github.com/Bigous/ng2-highcharts/wiki) articles.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nTo versions until v0.6.3 look at [changelog page](CHANGELOG.md).\r\n\r\nTo posterior versions, look at [release page](https://github.com/Bigous/ng2-highcharts/releases).\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\n[<img alt=\"Bigous\" src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6886560?v=3&s=117\" width=\"117\">](https://github.com/Bigous)[<img alt=\"k3nsei\" src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/190422?v=3&s=117\" width=\"117\">](https://github.com/k3nsei)[<img alt=\"sasidhar\" src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/897339?v=3&s=117\" width=\"117\">](https://github.com/sasidhar)[<img alt=\"josx\" src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/791137?v=3&s=117\" width=\"117\">](https://github.com/josx)[<img alt=\"nickmorton\" src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11538384?v=3&s=117\" width=\"117\">](https://github.com/nickmorton)[<img alt=\"NathanWalker\" src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/457187?v=3&s=117\" width=\"117\">](https://github.com/NathanWalker)\r\n\r\n[<img alt=\"pleerock\" src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1753397?v=3&s=117\" width=\"117\">](https://github.com/pleerock)[<img alt=\"tianyi-wang-rockalltech\" src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20535575?v=3&s=117\" width=\"117\">](https://github.com/tianyi-wang-rockalltech)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMIT © [Richard Natal](http://github.com/Bigous)",

If this\nlibrary saves you time, then it's saving you money. The cost of developing\nthe Forge software was on the order of several hundred hours and tens of\nthousands of dollars.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n          NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.",

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   Copyright 2016 Matthew Davidson\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License.",

An optional `options` object may be passed in which\nrespects the following options:\n\n * `filename` - String - the filename to use in error stack traces. Defaults to `proxy.pac`.\n * `sandbox` - Object - a map of functions to include in the sandbox of the\n JavaScript environment where the JS code will be executed. i.e. if you wanted to\n include the common `alert` function you could pass `alert: console.log`. For\n async functions, you must set the `async = true` property on the function\n instance, and the JS code will be able to invoke the function as if it were\n synchronous.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[pac-file-docs]: https://web.archive.org/web/20070602031929/http://wp.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/2.0/relnotes/demo/proxy-live.html\n[pac-wikipedia]: http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_auto-config",

    "licenseText": "# path-proxy\n\nGiven an group of paths (say, from an API schema), you might need to create a\nset of proxy objects for interacting with those paths. This is the situation I\nfound myself in while working on the [Node client for the Heroku API][heroku_client].\n\nGiven a set of paths and a base constructor function, path-proxy will create a\nnetwork of logical proxy objects based on the paths and attach it to the\nconstructor's prototype.\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\nnpm install path-proxy --save\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar pathProxy = require('path-proxy');\n\nfunction ApiClient() {}\n\npathProxy.proxy(ApiClient, [\n  \"/foo\",\n  \"/foo/{id}/bar\"\n]);\n\nvar client = new ApiClient();\nclient.foo(\"qux\").bar();\n```\n\nThis may not appear all that useful—they're mostly just empty functions—until you\nstart mucking around with their prototypes:\n\n```javascript\nvar BarProxy = pathProxy.pathProxy(ApiClient, \"/foo/{id}/bar\");\nBarProxy.prototype.sayHello = function () {\n  console.log(\"hello\");\n};\n\nclient.foo(\"qux\").bar().sayHello(); // Logs \"hello\".\n```\n\nThey also have access to a few useful attributes:\n\n```javascript\nvar baz = client.foo(\"qux\").bar(\"baz\");\nbaz.params;       // [\"qux\", \"baz\"]\nbaz.pathSegments; // [\"foo\", \"qux\", \"bar\", \"baz\"]\nbaz.path;         // \"/foo/qux/bar/baz\"\n```\n\nAnd can access the instance of the base constructor they're based off of:\n\n```javascript\nApiClient.prototype.delete = function (path, callback) {\n  var message = this.name + \" deleted at \" + path;\n  callback(message);\n};\n\nvar client = new ApiClient();\nclient.name = \"Jonathan\";\n\nBarProxy.prototype.delete = function (callback) {\n  this.base.delete(this.path, callback);\n};\n\n// This:\nclient.foo(\"qux\").bar(\"baz\").delete(function (message) {\n  // message == \"Jonathan deleted at /foo/qux/bar/baz\"\n});\n\n// Is equivalent to this:\nclient.delete(\"/foo/qux/bar/baz\", function (message) {\n  // message == \"Jonathan deleted at /foo/qux/bar/baz\"\n});\n```\n\n## Tests\n\npath-proxy uses jasmine-node for tests. To run them:\n\n```sh\n$ npm install\n$ npm test\n```\n\n[heroku_client]: https://github.com/heroku/node-heroku-client",

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

This can give us some really useful reuse of styles:\n\n```css\n.globalButtonStyle {\n  background: white;\n  border: 1px solid;\n  border-radius: 0.25rem;\n}\n.globalButtonStyle:hover {\n  box-shadow: 0 0 4px -2px;\n}\n:local(.continueButton) {\n  compose-with: globalButtonStyle;\n  color: green;\n}\n```\n\nbecomes:\n\n```\n.globalButtonStyle {\n  background: white;\n  border: 1px solid;\n  border-radius: 0.25rem;\n}\n.globalButtonStyle:hover {\n  box-shadow: 0 0 4px -2px;\n}\n:local(.continueButton) {\n  compose-with: globalButtonStyle;\n  color: green;\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** you can also use `composes` as a shorthand for `compose-with`\n\n## Local-by-default & reuse across files\n\nYou're looking for [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). It uses this plugin as well as a few others, and it's amazing.\n\n## Building\n\n```\nnpm install\nnpm test\n```\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/css-modules/postcss-modules-scope.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/css-modules/postcss-modules-scope)\n\n* Lines: [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/css-modules/postcss-modules-scope/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/css-modules/postcss-modules-scope?branch=master)\n* Statements: [![codecov.io](http://codecov.io/github/css-modules/postcss-modules-scope/coverage.svg?branch=master)](http://codecov.io/github/css-modules/postcss-modules-scope?branch=master)\n\n## Development\n\n- `npm autotest` will watch `src` and `test` for changes and run the tests, and transpile the ES6 to ES5 on success\n\n## License\n\nISC\n\n## With thanks\n\n- Mark Dalgleish\n- Tobias Koppers\n- Guy Bedford\n\n---\nGlen Maddern, 2015.",

An LRU cache is used, so the same `http.Agent` instance will be\nreturned if identical args are passed in.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n\n[http-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-http-proxy-agent\n[https-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent\n[socks-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-socks-proxy-agent\n[pac-proxy-agent]: https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-pac-proxy-agent",

If no proxy is set, an empty string is\nreturned.\n\nIt is your responsibility to actually proxy the request using the given URL.\n\nInstallation:\n\n```sh\nnpm install proxy-from-env\n```\n\n## Example\nThis example shows how the data for a URL can be fetched via the\n[`http` module](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html), in a proxy-aware way.\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require('http');\nvar parseUrl = require('url').parse;\nvar getProxyForUrl = require('proxy-from-env').getProxyForUrl;\n\nvar some_url = 'http://example.com/something';\n\n// // Example, if there is a proxy server at 10.0.0.1:1234, then setting the\n// // http_proxy environment variable causes the request to go through a proxy.\n// process.env.http_proxy = 'http://10.0.0.1:1234';\n// \n// // But if the host to be proxied is listed in NO_PROXY, then the request is\n// // not proxied (but a direct request is made).\n// process.env.no_proxy = 'example.com';\n\nvar proxy_url = getProxyForUrl(some_url);  // <-- Our magic.\nif (proxy_url) {\n  // Should be proxied through proxy_url.\n  var parsed_some_url = parseUrl(some_url);\n  var parsed_proxy_url = parseUrl(proxy_url);\n  // A HTTP proxy is quite simple. It is similar to a normal request, except the\n  // path is an absolute URL, and the proxied URL's host is put in the header\n  // instead of the server's actual host.\n  httpOptions = {\n    protocol: parsed_proxy_url.protocol,\n    hostname: parsed_proxy_url.hostname,\n    port: parsed_proxy_url.port,\n    path: parsed_some_url.href,\n    headers: {\n      Host: parsed_some_url.host,  // = host name + optional port.\n    },\n  };\n} else {\n  // Direct request.\n  httpOptions = some_url;\n}\nhttp.get(httpOptions, function(res) {\n  var responses = [];\n  res.on('data', function(chunk) { responses.push(chunk); });\n  res.on('end', function() { console.log(responses.join(''));  });\n});\n\n```\n\n## Environment variables\nThe environment variables can be specified in lowercase or uppercase, with the\nlowercase name having precedence over the uppercase variant. A variable that is\nnot set has the same meaning as a variable that is set but has no value.\n\n### NO\\_PROXY\n\n`NO_PROXY` is a list of host names (optionally with a port). If the input URL\nmatches any of the entries in `NO_PROXY`, then the input URL should be fetched\nby a direct request (i.e. without a proxy).\n\nMatching follows the following rules:\n\n- `NO_PROXY=*` disables all proxies.\n- Space and commas may be used to separate the entries in the `NO_PROXY` list.\n- If `NO_PROXY` does not contain any entries, then proxies are never disabled.\n- If a port is added after the host name, then the ports must match. If the URL\n  does not have an explicit port name, the protocol's default port is used.\n- Generally, the proxy is only disabled if the host name is an exact match for\n  an entry in the `NO_PROXY` list. The only exceptions are entries that start\n  with a dot or with a wildcard; then the proxy is disabled if the host name\n  ends with the entry.\n\nSee `test.js` for examples of what should match and what does not.\n\n### \\*\\_PROXY\n\nThe environment variable used for the proxy depends on the protocol of the URL.\nFor example, `https://example.com` uses the \"https\" protocol, and therefore the\nproxy to be used is `HTTPS_PROXY` (_NOT_ `HTTP_PROXY`, which is _only_ used for\nhttp:-URLs).\n\nThe library is not limited to http(s), other schemes such as\n`FTP_PROXY` (ftp:),\n`WSS_PROXY` (wss:),\n`WS_PROXY` (ws:)\nare also supported.\n\nIf present, `ALL_PROXY` is used as fallback if there is no other match.\n\n\n## External resources\nThe exact way of parsing the environment variables is not codified in any\nstandard. This library is designed to be compatible with formats as expected by\nexisting software.\nThe following resources were used to determine the desired behavior:\n\n- cURL:\n  https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html#ENVIRONMENT  \n  https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/4af40b3646d3b09f68e419f7ca866ff395d1f897/lib/url.c#L4446-L4514  \n  https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/4af40b3646d3b09f68e419f7ca866ff395d1f897/lib/url.c#L4608-L4638  \n\n- wget: \n  https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html#Proxies  \n  http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/wget.git/tree/src/init.c?id=636a5f9a1c508aa39e35a3a8e9e54520a284d93d#n383  \n  http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/wget.git/tree/src/retr.c?id=93c1517c4071c4288ba5a4b038e7634e4c6b5482#n1278  \n\n- W3:\n  https://www.w3.org/Daemon/User/Proxies/ProxyClients.html  \n\n- Python's urllib:\n  https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/936135bb97fe04223aa30ca6e98eac8f3ed6b349/Lib/urllib/request.py#L755-L782  \n  https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/936135bb97fe04223aa30ca6e98eac8f3ed6b349/Lib/urllib/request.py#L2444-L2479",

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\n\nYou must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\nYou must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and\n\nYou must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\n\nIf the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.

You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS",

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\n\nYou must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\nYou must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and\n\nYou must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\n\nIf the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.

You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS",

Each priority level must finish entirely before the\nnext priority level is run.  See\n[PRIORITIES](https://github.com/iarna/run-queue#priorities) below.  This is\neven true if concurrency is set high enough that all of the regular queue\ncan execute at once, for instance, with `maxConcurrency: 10`:\n\n```\n[ 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1 ]\n```\n\n## API\n\n### const queue = new RunQueue(options)\n\nCreate a new queue. Options may contain:\n\n* maxConcurrency - (Default: `1`) The maximum number of jobs to execute at once.\n* Promise - (Default: global.Promise) The promise implementation to use.\n\n### queue.add (prio, fn, args)\n\nAdd a new job to the end of the queue at priority `prio` that will run `fn`\nwith `args`. If `fn` is async then it should return a Promise.\n\n### queue.run ()\n\nStart running the job queue.  Returns a Promise that resolves when either\nall the jobs are complete or a job ends in error (throws or returns a\nrejected promise). If a job ended in error then this Promise will be rejected\nwith that error and no further queue running will be done.\n\n## PRIORITIES\n\nPriorities are any integer value >= 0.\n\nLowest is executed first.\n\nPriorities essentially represent distinct job queues.  All jobs in a queue\nmust complete before the next highest priority job queue is executed.\n\nThis means that if you have two queues, `0` and `1` then ALL jobs in `0`\nmust complete before ANY execute in `1`.  If you add new `0` level jobs\nwhile `1` level jobs are running then it will switch back processing the `0`\nqueue and won't execute any more `1` jobs till all of the new `0` jobs\ncomplete.",

REST API for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).\n\n## Install\n\n```shell\nnpm install saucelabs\n```\n\n## Test\n\nTo run the test suite, first invoke the following command within the repo, installing the development dependencies:\n\n```shell\nnpm install\n```\n\nThen run the tests:\n\n```shell\nnpm test\n```\n\n## Authors\n\n- Dan Jenkins ([danjenkins](https://github.com/danjenkins))\n- Mathieu Sabourin ([OniOni](https://github.com/OniOni))\n- Daniel Perez Alvarez ([unindented](https://github.com/unindented))\n\n## Writing a script\n\n```javascript\nvar SauceLabs = require('saucelabs');\n\nvar myAccount = new SauceLabs({\n  username: \"your-sauce-username\",\n  password: \"your-sauce-api-key\"\n});\n\nmyAccount.getAccountDetails(function (err, res) {\n

if (res.error) {\n                str += \"\\033[31m Error: \" + res.error + \" \\033[0m\";\n              }\n              console.log(str);\n            });\n          }\n        }\n      });\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\n## Using a proxy\nIf you're behind a corporate firewall or would like to utilize a proxy, define it in the constructor like this:\n\n```javascript\nvar sauce = new SauceLabs({\n  username: \"your-sauce-username\",\n  password: \"your-sauce-api-key\",\n  proxy: \"https://your-proxy.com:8000\"\n});\n```\n\n\n## Supported Methods\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th

Used in codelyzer for keeping the code compatible across different versions of the Angular compiler.\n\n# Demo\n\n```bash\n$ npm i semver-dsl --save\n```\n\n```ts\nimport {SemVerDSL} from 'semver-dsl';\n\nconst base = () => {};\nconst elseIf1 = () => {};\nconst elseIf2 = () => {};\nconst else = () => console.log('I will be invoked!');\n\nSemVerDSL('3.0.0')\n  .gt('3.2.1', base)\n  .elseIf.gt('3.0.1', elseIf1)\n  .elseIf.between('3.0.1', '3.1.8', elseIf2)\n  .else(else);\n```\n\nIn the example above will be invoked `else`.\n\n# API\n\n- `SemDSL(version: string)` - factory which accepts a version and returns an object.\n- `gte(version: string, callback?: Function): ISemContextualDSL` - returns an object with `elseIf` and `else` properties.\n- `lte(version: string, callback?: Function): ISemContextualDSL` - returns an object with `elseIf` and `else` properties.\n- `gt(version: string, callback?: Function): ISemContextualDSL` - returns an object with `elseIf` and `else` properties.\n- `lt(version: string, callback?: Function): ISemContextualDSL` - returns an object with `elseIf` and `else` properties.\n- `eq(version: string, callback?: Function): ISemContextualDSL` - returns an object with `elseIf` and `else` properties.\n- `neq(version: string, callback?: Function): ISemContextualDSL` - returns an object with `elseIf` and `else` properties.\n- `between(v1: string, v2: string, callback?: Function): ISemContextualDSL` - returns an object with `elseIf` properties.\n- `elseIf` - returns an object of type `ISemVerDSL` bound to the previous predicate.\n- `else` - invokes given callback if all of the previous conditions have failed.\n\n```ts\nexport interface ISemVerDSL {\n  gte(version: string, callback: Function): ISemContextualDSL;\n  lte(version: string, callback: Function): ISemContextualDSL;\n  gt(version: string, callback: Function): ISemContextualDSL;\n  lt(version: string, callback: Function): ISemContextualDSL;\n  eq(version: string, callback: Function): ISemContextualDSL;\n  neq(version: string, callback: Function): ISemContextualDSL;\n  between(v1: string, v2: string, callback: Function): ISemContextualDSL;\n}\n```\n\n```ts\nexport interface ISemVerContextBoundDSL {\n  elseIf: ISemVerDSL;\n  else(callback: Function): void;\n}\n```\n\n# License\n\nMIT",

See the \"Examples\" section below.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall with `npm`:\n\n``` bash\n$ npm install socks-proxy-agent\n```\n\n\nExamples\n--------\n\n#### `http` module example\n\n``` js\nvar url = require('url');\nvar http = require('http');\nvar SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');\n\n// SOCKS proxy to connect to\nvar proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:9050';\nconsole.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);\n\n// HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to\nvar endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'http://nodejs.org/api/';\nconsole.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);\nvar opts = url.parse(endpoint);\n\n// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information\nvar agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);\nopts.agent = agent;\n\nhttp.get(opts, function (res) {\n  console.log('\"response\" event!', res.headers);\n  res.pipe(process.stdout);\n});\n```\n\n#### `https` module example\n\n``` js\nvar url = require('url');\nvar https = require('https');\nvar SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');\n\n// SOCKS proxy to connect to\nvar proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:9050';\nconsole.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);\n\n// HTTP endpoint for the proxy to connect to\nvar endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://encrypted.google.com/';\nconsole.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);\nvar opts = url.parse(endpoint);\n\n// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information\n// NOTE: the `true` second argument! Means to use TLS encryption on the socket\nvar agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy, true);\nopts.agent = agent;\n\nhttps.get(opts, function (res) {\n  console.log('\"response\" event!', res.headers);\n  res.pipe(process.stdout);\n});\n```\n\n#### `ws` WebSocket connection example\n\n``` js\nvar WebSocket = require('ws');\nvar SocksProxyAgent = require('socks-proxy-agent');\n\n// SOCKS proxy to connect to\nvar proxy = process.env.socks_proxy || 'socks://127.0.0.1:9050';\nconsole.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);\n\n// WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to\nvar endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';\nconsole.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);\n\n// create an instance of the `SocksProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information\nvar agent = new SocksProxyAgent(proxy);\n\n// initiate the WebSocket connection\nvar socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });\n\nsocket.on('open', function () {\n  console.log('\"open\" event!');\n  socket.send('hello world');\n});\n\nsocket.on('message', function (data, flags) {\n  console.log('\"message\" event! %j %j', data, flags);\n  socket.close();\n});\n```\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.",

According to the spec, source maps have the\nfollowing attributes:\n\n* `version`: Which version of the source map spec this map is following.\n\n* `sources`: An array of URLs to the original source files.\n\n* `names`: An array of identifiers which can be referrenced by individual\n  mappings.\n\n* `sourceRoot`: Optional. The URL root from which all sources are relative.\n\n* `sourcesContent`: Optional. An array of contents of the original source files.\n\n* `mappings`: A string of base64 VLQs which contain the actual mappings.\n\n* `file`: Optional. The generated filename this source map is associated with.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.computeColumnSpans()\n\nCompute the last column for each generated mapping. The last column is\ninclusive.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.originalPositionFor(generatedPosition)\n\nReturns the original source, line, and column information for the generated\nsource's line and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with\nthe following properties:\n\n* `line`: The line number in the generated source.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the generated source.\n\n* `bias`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND` or\n  `SourceMapConsumer.LEAST_UPPER_BOUND`. Specifies whether to return the closest\n  element that is smaller than or greater than the one we are searching for,\n  respectively, if the exact element cannot be found.  Defaults to\n  `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND`.\n\nand an object is returned with the following properties:\n\n* `source`: The original source file, or null if this information is not\n  available.\n\n* `line`: The line number in the original source, or null if this information is\n  not available.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the original source, or null or null if this\n  information is not available.\n\n* `name`: The original identifier, or null if this information is not available.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.generatedPositionFor(originalPosition)\n\nReturns the generated line and column information for the original source,\nline, and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with\nthe following properties:\n\n* `source`: The filename of the original source.\n\n* `line`: The line number in the original source.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the original source.\n\nand an object is returned with the following properties:\n\n* `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.allGeneratedPositionsFor(originalPosition)\n\nReturns all generated line and column information for the original source, line,\nand column provided. If no column is provided, returns all mappings\ncorresponding to a either the line we are searching for or the next closest line\nthat has any mappings. Otherwise, returns all mappings corresponding to the\ngiven line and either the column we are searching for or the next closest column\nthat has any offsets.\n\nThe only argument is an object with the following properties:\n\n* `source`: The filename of the original source.\n\n* `line`: The line number in the original source.\n\n* `column`: Optional. The column number in the original source.\n\nand an array of objects is returned, each with the following properties:\n\n* `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.hasContentsOfAllSources()\n\nReturn true if we have the embedded source content for every source listed in\nthe source map, false otherwise.\n\nIn other words, if this method returns `true`, then `smc.sourceContentFor(s)`\nwill succeed for every source `s` in `smc.sources`.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.sourceContentFor(source[, returnNullOnMissing])\n\nReturns the original source content for the source provided. The only\nargument is the URL of the original source file.\n\nIf the source content for the given source is not found, then an error is\nthrown. Optionally, pass `true` as the second param to have `null` returned\ninstead.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.eachMapping(callback, context, order)\n\nIterate over each mapping between an original source/line/column and a\ngenerated line/column in this source map.\n\n* `callback`: The function that is called with each mapping. Mappings have the\n  form `{ source, generatedLine, generatedColumn, originalLine, originalColumn,\n  name }`\n\n* `context`: Optional. If specified, this object will be the value of `this`\n  every time that `callback` is called.\n\n* `order`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER` or\n  `SourceMapConsumer.ORIGINAL_ORDER`. Specifies whether you want to iterate over\n  the mappings sorted by the generated file's line/column order or the\n  original's source/line/column order, respectively. Defaults to\n  `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER`.\n\n### SourceMapGenerator\n\nAn instance of the SourceMapGenerator represents a source map which is being\nbuilt incrementally.\n\n#### new SourceMapGenerator([startOfSourceMap])\n\nYou may pass an object with the following properties:\n\n* `file`: The filename of the generated source that this source map is\n  associated with.\n\n* `sourceRoot`: A root for all relative URLs in this source map.\n\n* `skipValidation`: Optional. When `true`, disables validation of mappings as\n  they are added. This can improve performance but should be used with\n  discretion, as a last resort. Even then, one should avoid using this flag when\n  running tests, if possible.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.fromSourceMap(sourceMapConsumer)\n\nCreates a new SourceMapGenerator based on a SourceMapConsumer\n\n* `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.addMapping(mapping)\n\nAdd a single mapping from original source line and column to the generated\nsource's line and column for this source map being created. The mapping object\nshould have the following properties:\n\n* `generated`: An object with the generated line and column positions.\n\n* `original`: An object with the original line and column positions.\n\n* `source`: The original source file (relative to the sourceRoot).\n\n* `name`: An optional original token name for this mapping.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)\n\nSet the source content for an original source file.\n\n* `sourceFile` the URL of the original source file.\n\n* `sourceContent` the content of the source file.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.applySourceMap(sourceMapConsumer[, sourceFile[, sourceMapPath]])\n\nApplies a SourceMap for a source file to the SourceMap.\nEach mapping to the supplied source file is rewritten using the\nsupplied SourceMap. Note: The resolution for the resulting mappings\nis the minimium of this map and the supplied map.\n\n* `sourceMapConsumer`: The SourceMap to be applied.\n\n* `sourceFile`: Optional. The filename of the source file.\n  If omitted, sourceMapConsumer.file will be used, if it exists.\n  Otherwise an error will be thrown.\n\n* `sourceMapPath`: Optional. The dirname of the path to the SourceMap\n  to be applied. If relative, it is relative to the SourceMap.\n\n  This parameter is needed when the two SourceMaps aren't in the same\n  directory, and the SourceMap to be applied contains relative source\n  paths. If so, those relative source paths need to be rewritten\n  relative to the SourceMap.\n\n  If omitted, it is assumed that both SourceMaps are in the same directory,\n  thus not needing any rewriting. (Supplying `'.'` has the same effect.)\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.toString()\n\nRenders the source map being generated to a string.\n\n### SourceNode\n\nSourceNodes provide a way to abstract over interpolating and/or concatenating\nsnippets of generated JavaScript source code, while maintaining the line and\ncolumn information associated between those snippets and the original source\ncode. This is useful as the final intermediate representation a compiler might\nuse before outputting the generated JS and source map.\n\n#### new SourceNode([line, column, source[, chunk[, name]]])\n\n* `line`: The original line number associated with this source node, or null if\n  it isn't associated with an original line.\n\n* `column`: The original column number associated with this source node, or null\n  if it isn't associated with an original column.\n\n* `source`: The original source's filename; null if no filename is provided.\n\n* `chunk`: Optional. Is immediately passed to `SourceNode.prototype.add`, see\n  below.\n\n* `name`: Optional. The original identifier.\n\n#### SourceNode.fromStringWithSourceMap(code, sourceMapConsumer[, relativePath])\n\nCreates a SourceNode from generated code and a SourceMapConsumer.\n\n* `code`: The generated code\n\n* `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap for the generated code\n\n* `relativePath` The optional path that relative sources in `sourceMapConsumer`\n  should be relative to.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.add(chunk)\n\nAdd a chunk of generated JS to this source node.\n\n* `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of\n   `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.prepend(chunk)\n\nPrepend a chunk of generated JS to this source node.\n\n* `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of\n   `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)\n\nSet the source content for a source file. This will be added to the\n`SourceMap` in the `sourcesContent` field.\n\n* `sourceFile`: The filename of the source file\n\n* `sourceContent`: The content of the source file\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.walk(fn)\n\nWalk over the tree of JS snippets in this node and its children. The walking\nfunction is called once for each snippet of JS and is passed that snippet and\nthe its original associated source's line/column location.\n\n* `fn`: The traversal function.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.walkSourceContents(fn)\n\nWalk over the tree of SourceNodes. The walking function is called for each\nsource file content and is passed the filename and source content.\n\n* `fn`: The traversal function.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.join(sep)\n\nLike `Array.prototype.join` except for SourceNodes. Inserts the separator\nbetween each of this source node's children.\n\n* `sep`: The separator.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.replaceRight(pattern, replacement)\n\nCall `String.prototype.replace` on the very right-most source snippet. Useful\nfor trimming whitespace from the end of a source node, etc.\n\n* `pattern`: The pattern to replace.\n\n* `replacement`: The thing to replace the pattern with.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.toString()\n\nReturn the string representation of this source node. Walks over the tree and\nconcatenates all the various snippets together to one string.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.toStringWithSourceMap([startOfSourceMap])\n\nReturns the string representation of this tree of source nodes, plus a\nSourceMapGenerator which contains all the mappings between the generated and\noriginal sources.\n\nThe arguments are the same as those to `new SourceMapGenerator`.\n\n## Tests\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map)\n\nInstall NodeJS version 0.8.0 or greater, then run `node test/run-tests.js`.\n\nTo add new tests, create a new file named `test/test-<your new test name>.js`\nand export your test functions with names that start with \"test\", for example\n\n```js\nexports[\"test doing the foo bar\"] = function (assert, util) {\n  ...\n};\n```\n\nThe new test will be located automatically when you run the suite.\n\nThe `util` argument is the test utility module located at `test/source-map/util`.\n\nThe `assert` argument is a cut down version of node's assert module. You have\naccess to the following assertion functions:\n\n* `doesNotThrow`\n\n* `equal`\n\n* `ok`\n\n* `strictEqual`\n\n* `throws`\n\n(The reason for the restricted set of test functions is because we need the\ntests to run inside Firefox's test suite as well and so the assert module is\nshimmed in that environment. See `build/assert-shim.js`.)\n\n[format]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n[feature]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/DevTools/Features/SourceMap\n[Dryice]: https://github.com/mozilla/dryice",

Also, `spdy` is compatible with Express.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Examples\n\nServer:\n```javascript\nvar spdy = require('spdy'),\n    fs = require('fs');\n\nvar options = {\n  // Private key\n  key: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-key.pem'),\n\n  // Fullchain file or cert file (prefer the former)\n  cert: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-fullchain.pem'),\n\n  // **optional** SPDY-specific options\n  spdy: {\n    protocols: [ 'h2', 'spdy/3.1', ..., 'http/1.1' ],\n    plain: false,\n\n    // **optional**\n    // Parse first incoming X_FORWARDED_FOR frame and put it to the\n    // headers of every request.\n    // NOTE: Use with care! This should not be used without some proxy that\n    // will *always* send X_FORWARDED_FOR\n    'x-forwarded-for': true,\n\n    connection: {\n      windowSize: 1024 * 1024, // Server's window size\n\n      // **optional** if true - server will send 3.1 frames on 3.0 *plain* spdy\n      autoSpdy31: false\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nvar server = spdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {\n  res.writeHead(200);\n  res.end('hello world!');\n});\n\nserver.listen(3000);\n```\n\nClient:\n```javascript\nvar spdy = require('spdy');\nvar https = require('https');\n\nvar agent = spdy.createAgent({\n  host: 'www.google.com',\n  port: 443,\n\n  // Optional SPDY options\n  spdy: {\n    plain: false,\n    ssl: true,\n\n    // **optional** send X_FORWARDED_FOR\n    'x-forwarded-for': '127.0.0.1'\n  }\n});\n\nhttps.get({\n  host: 'www.google.com',\n  agent: agent\n}, function(response) {\n  console.log('yikes');\n  // Here it goes like with any other node.js HTTP request\n  // ...\n  // And once we're done - we may close TCP connection to server\n  // NOTE: All non-closed requests will die!\n  agent.close();\n}).end();\n```\n\nPlease note that if you use a custom agent, by default all connection-level\nerrors will result in an uncaught exception. To handle these errors subscribe\nto the `error` event and re-emit the captured error:\n\n```javascript\nvar agent = spdy.createAgent({\n  host: 'www.google.com',\n  port: 443\n}).once('error', function (err) {\n  this.emit(err);\n});\n```\n\n#### Push streams\n\nIt is possible to initiate [PUSH_PROMISE][5] to send content to clients _before_\nthe client requests it.\n\n```javascript\nspdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {\n  var stream = res.push('/main.js', {\n    status: 200, // optional\n    method: 'GET', // optional\n    request: {\n      accept: '*/*'\n    },\n    response: {\n      'content-type': 'application/javascript'\n    }\n  });\n  stream.on('error', function() {\n  });\n  stream.end('alert(\"hello from push stream!\");');\n\n  res.end('<script src=\"/main.js\"></script>');\n}).listen(3000);\n```\n\n[PUSH_PROMISE][5] may be sent using the `push()` method on the current response\nobject.  The signature of the `push()` method is:\n\n`.push('/some/relative/url', { request: {...}, response: {...} }, callback)`\n\nSecond argument contains headers for both PUSH_PROMISE and emulated response.\n`callback` will receive two arguments: `err` (if any error is happened) and a\n[Duplex][4] stream as the second argument.\n\nClient usage:\n```javascript\nvar agent = spdy.createAgent({ /* ... */ });\nvar req = http.get({\n  host: 'www.google.com',\n  agent: agent\n}, function(response) {\n});\nreq.on('push', function(stream) {\n  stream.on('error', function(err) {\n    // Handle error\n  });\n  // Read data from stream\n});\n```\n\nNOTE: You're responsible for the `stream` object once given it in `.push()`\ncallback or `push` event. Hence ignoring `error` event on it will result in\nuncaught exception and crash your program.\n\n#### Trailing headers\n\nServer usage:\n```javascript\nfunction (req, res) {\n  // Send trailing headers to client\n  res.addTrailers({ header1: 'value1', header2: 'value2' });\n\n  // On client's trailing headers\n  req.on('trailers', function(headers) {\n    // ...\n  });\n}\n```\n\nClient usage:\n```javascript\nvar req = http.request({ agent: spdyAgent, /* ... */ }).function (res) {\n  // On server's trailing headers\n  res.on('trailers', function(headers) {\n    // ...\n  });\n});\nreq.write('stuff');\nreq.addTrailers({ /* ... */ });\nreq.end();\n```\n\n#### Options\n\nAll options supported by [tls][2] work with node-spdy.\n\nAdditional options may be passed via `spdy` sub-object:\n\n* `plain` - if defined, server will ignore NPN and ALPN data and choose whether\n  to use spdy or plain http by looking at first data packet.\n* `ssl` - if `false` and `options.plain` is `true`, `http.Server` will be used\n  as a `base` class for created server.\n* `maxChunk` - if set and non-falsy, limits number of bytes sent in one DATA\n  chunk. Setting it to non-zero value is recommended if you care about\n  interleaving of outgoing data from multiple different streams.\n  (defaults to 8192)\n* `protocols` - list of NPN/ALPN protocols to use (default is:\n  `['h2','spdy/3.1', 'spdy/3', 'spdy/2','http/1.1', 'http/1.0']`)\n* `protocol` - use specific protocol if no NPN/ALPN ex In addition,\n* `maxStreams` - set \"[maximum concurrent streams][3]\" protocol option\n\n### API\n\nAPI is compatible with `http` and `https` module, but you can use another\nfunction as base class for SPDYServer.\n\n```javascript\nspdy.createServer(\n  [base class constructor, i.e. https.Server],\n  { /* keys and options */ }, // <- the only one required argument\n  [request listener]\n).listen([port], [host], [callback]);\n```\n\nRequest listener will receive two arguments: `request` and `response`. They're\nboth instances of `http`'s `IncomingMessage` and `OutgoingMessage`. But three\ncustom properties are added to both of them: `isSpdy`, `spdyVersion`. `isSpdy`\nis `true` when the request was processed using HTTP2/SPDY protocols, it is\n`false` in case of HTTP/1.1 fallback. `spdyVersion` is either of: `2`, `3`,\n`3.1`, or `4` (for HTTP2).\n\n\n#### Contributors\n\n* [Fedor Indutny](https://github.com/indutny)\n* [Chris Strom](https://github.com/eee-c)\n* [François de Metz](https://github.com/francois2metz)\n* [Ilya Grigorik](https://github.com/igrigorik)\n* [Roberto Peon](https://github.com/grmocg)\n* [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa](https://github.com/tatsuhiro-t)\n* [Jesse Cravens](https://github.com/jessecravens)\n\n#### LICENSE\n\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\n\nCopyright Fedor Indutny, 2015.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

To enforce this, you can call the `setGracefulCleanup()` method:\n\n```javascript\nvar tmp = require('tmp');\n\ntmp.setGracefulCleanup();\n```\n\n## Options\n\nAll options are optional :)\n\n  * `mode`: the file mode to create with, it fallbacks to `0600` on file creation and `0700` on directory creation\n  * `prefix`: the optional prefix, fallbacks to `tmp-` if not provided\n  * `postfix`: the optional postfix, fallbacks to `.tmp` on file creation\n  * `template`: [`mkstemps`][3] like filename template, no default\n  * `dir`: the optional temporary directory, fallbacks to system default (guesses from environment)\n  * `tries`: how many times should the function try to get a unique filename before giving up, default `3`\n  * `keep`: signals that the temporary file or directory should not be deleted on exit, default is `false`, means delete\n  * `unsafeCleanup`: recursively removes the created temporary directory, even when it's not empty. default is `false`\n\n[1]: http://nodejs.org/\n[2]: https://github.com/bruce/node-temp\n[3]: http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man3/mkstemp.3.html",

    "licenseText": "[TypeScript Collections](https://github.com/basarat/typescript-collections/)\n====================\n\nIt is a complete, fully tested data structure library written in TypeScript.\n\nThis project uses TypeScript Generics so you need TS 0.9 and above.\n\n[This projects supports UMD (Universal Module Definition)](https://github.com/umdjs/umd)\n\n![typescript-collections downloads](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/typescript-collections.png)\n\nIncluded data structures\n---------------------\n\n- Linked List\n- Dictionary - [Example](#a-sample-on-dictionary)\n- Multi Dictionary\n- Linked Dictionary\n- Default Dictionary - [Info](#default-dictionary)\n- Binary Search Tree\n- Multi Root Tree - [Info](#multi-root-tree)\n- Stack\n- Queue\n- Set - [Example](#example)\n- Bag\n- Binary Heap\n- Priority Queue\n\nIt also includes several functions for manipulating arrays.\n\nUsage\n--------------------\n\n`npm install typescript-collections --save`\n\nES6 `import ... from`\n\n```typescript\nimport * as Collections from 'typescript-collections';\n```\n\nor TypeScript `import ... require`\n\n```typescript\nimport Collections = require('typescript-collections');\n```\n\nor JavaScript `var ... require`\n\n```js\nvar Collections = require('typescript-collections');\n```\n\n![](https://zippy.gfycat.com/SeriousPointlessCob.gif)\n\nVisual Studio or other TypeScript IDE, will provide you with complete Intellisense (autocomplete) for your types.\nThe compiler will ensure that the collections contain the correct elements.\n\nA sample Visual Studio project is in the demo folder.\n\nAlso available on NuGet : <http://www.nuget.org/packages/typescript.collections/>\nThanks to <https://github.com/georgiosd>\n\nExample\n--------------------\n\n```typescript\nimport * as Collections from 'typescript-collections';\n\nvar mySet = new Collections.Set<number>();\nmySet.add(123);\nmySet.add(123); // Duplicates not allowed in a set\n// The following will give error due to wrong type:\n// mySet.add(\"asdf\"); // Can only add numbers since that is the type argument.\n\nvar myQueue = new Collections.Queue();\nmyQueue.enqueue(1);\nmyQueue.enqueue(2);\n\nconsole.log(myQueue.dequeue()); // prints 1\nconsole.log(myQueue.dequeue()); // prints 2\n```\n\nTypings resolution\n-------------------\n\nRemember to set `\"moduleResolution\": \"node\"`, so TypeScript compiler can resolve typings in the `node_modules/typescript-collections` directory.\n\n![](http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c316/Tilosag/Screen%20Shot%202016-04-08%20at%2015.55.30.png)\n\nIn browser usage\n-------------------\n\nYou should include `umd.js` or `umd.min.js` from `dist/lib/` directory.\n\n```html\n<script src=\"[server public path]/typescript-collections/dist/lib/umd.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nA note on Equality\n-------------------\n\nEquality is important for hashing (e.g. dictionary / sets). Javascript only allows strings to be keys for the base dictionary {}.\nThis is why the implementation for these data structures uses the item's toString() method.\n\nmakeString utility function (aka. JSON.stringify)\n-------------------\n\nA simple function is provided for you when you need a quick toString that uses all properties. E.g:\n\n```typescript\nimport * as Collections from 'typescript-collections';\n\nclass Car {\n    constructor(public company: string, public type: string, public year: number) {\n    }\n    toString() {\n        // Short hand. Adds each own property\n        return Collections.util.makeString(this);\n    }\n}\n\nconsole.log(new Car(\"BMW\", \"A\", 2016).toString());\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```text\n{company:BMW,type:A,year:2016}\n```\n\nA Sample on Dictionary\n---------------------\n\n```typescript\nimport * as Collections from 'typescript-collections';\n\nclass Person {\n    constructor(public name: string, public yearOfBirth: number,public city?:string) {\n    }\n    toString() {\n        return this.name + \"-\" + this.yearOfBirth; // City is not a part of the key.\n    }\n}\n\nclass Car {\n    constructor(public company: string, public type: string, public year: number) {\n    }\n    toString() {\n        // Short hand. Adds each own property\n        return Collections.util.makeString(this);\n    }\n}\nvar dict = new Collections.Dictionary<Person, Car>();\ndict.setValue(new Person(\"john\", 1970,\"melbourne\"), new Car(\"honda\", \"city\", 2002));\ndict.setValue(new Person(\"gavin\", 1984), new Car(\"ferrari\", \"F50\", 2006));\nconsole.log(\"Orig\");\nconsole.log(dict);\n\n// Changes the same john, since city is not part of key\ndict.setValue(new Person(\"john\", 1970, \"sydney\"), new Car(\"honda\", \"accord\", 2006));\n// Add a new john\ndict.setValue(new Person(\"john\", 1971), new Car(\"nissan\", \"micra\", 2010));\nconsole.log(\"Updated\");\nconsole.log(dict);\n\n// Showing getting / setting a single car:\nconsole.log(\"Single Item\");\nvar person = new Person(\"john\", 1970);\nconsole.log(\"-Person:\");\nconsole.log(person);\n\nvar car = dict.getValue(person);\nconsole.log(\"-Car:\");\nconsole.log(car.toString());\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```text\nOrig\n{\n    john-1970 : {company:honda,type:city,year:2002}\n    gavin-1984 : {company:ferrari,type:F50,year:2006}\n}\nUpdated\n{\n    john-1970 : {company:honda,type:accord,year:2006}\n    gavin-1984 : {company:ferrari,type:F50,year:2006}\n    john-1971 : {company:nissan,type:micra,year:2010}\n}\nSingle Item\n-Person:\njohn-1970\n-Car:\n{company:honda,type:accord,year:2006}\n```\n\nDefault Dictionary\n---------------------\n\nAlso known as `Factory Dictionary` [[ref.](https://github.com/basarat/typescript-collections/pull/47)]\n\nIf a key doesn't exist, the Default Dictionary automatically creates it with `setDefault(defaultValue)`.\n\nDefault Dictionary is a @michaelneu contribution which copies Python's [defaultDict](https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict).\n\nMulti Root Tree\n---------------------\n\nIt's a [forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)#Forest) like data structure which must consist of unique keys. It exposes advanced node manipulation methods.\n\n```javascript\nimport * as Collections from 'typescript-collections';\n\nlet tree = new Collections.MultiRootTree();\ntree.insertIdIntoRoot('1');\n```\n\n```text\n{\n    rootIds: ['1']\n    nodes: { '1': [] }\n}\n```\n\nWhere `rootIds` are tree roots and `nodes` contains keys in order and describe keys nesting.\n\nConstraints\n\n- inserted keys MUST be unique\n\nTree manipulation methods\n\n- insertIdIntoRoot(id: string, position?: number)\n- insertIdIntoNode(nodeKey: string, id: string, position?: number)\n- insertIdAfterId(belowId: string, insertId: string)\n- insertIdBeforeId(beforeId: string, insertId: string)\n- insertIdIntoId(insideId: string, insertId: string)\n- moveIdBeforeId(moveId: string, beforeId: string)\n- moveIdAfterId(moveId: string, afterId: string)\n- moveIdIntoId(moveId: string, insideId: string, atStart = true)\n- deleteId(id: string)\n- getRootIds() - get a copy of rootIds\n- getNodes() - get a copy of nodes\n\nToDos:\n\n- drop unique key constraint\n\nDevelopment and contrbutions\n--------------------\n\nInstall dependencies and tools\n`npm run install_tools`\n\nCompile, test and check coverage\n`npm run all`\n\nSupported platforms\n--------------------\n\n- Every desktop and mobile browser (including IE6)\n- Node.js\n\n```text\nIf it supports JavaScript, it probably supports this library.\n```\n\nContact\n--------------------\n\nbas AT basarat.com\n\nProject is based on the excellent original javascript version called [buckets](https://github.com/mauriciosantos/buckets)",

    "licenseText": "# URI.js\n\nURI.js is an [RFC 3986](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) compliant, scheme extendable URI parsing/validating/resolving library for all JavaScript environments (browsers, Node.js, etc).\nIt is also compliant with the IRI ([RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt)), IDNA ([RFC 5890](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5890.txt)), IPv6 Address ([RFC 5952](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5952.txt)), IPv6 Zone Identifier ([RFC 6874](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6874.txt)) specifications.\n\nURI.js has an extensive test suite, and works in all (Node.js, web) environments. It weighs in at 6.2kb (gzipped, 16kb deflated).\n\n## API\n\n### Parsing\n\n\tURI.parse(\"uri://user:pass@example.com:123/one/two.three?q1=a1&q2=a2#body\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//  scheme : \"uri\",\n\t//  userinfo : \"user:pass\",\n\t//  host : \"example.com\",\n\t//  port : 123,\n\t//  path : \"/one/two.three\",\n\t//  query : \"q1=a1&q2=a2\",\n\t//  fragment : \"body\"\n\t//}\n\n### Serializing\n\n\tURI.serialize({scheme : \"http\", host : \"example.com\", fragment : \"footer\"}) === \"http://example.com/#footer\"\n\n### Resolving\n\n\tURI.resolve(\"uri://a/b/c/d?q\", \"../../g\") === \"uri://a/g\"\n\n### Normalizing\n\n\tURI.normalize(\"HTTP://ABC.com:80/%7Esmith/home.html\") === \"http://abc.com/~smith/home.html\"\n\n### Comparison\n\n\tURI.equal(\"example://a/b/c/%7Bfoo%7D\", \"eXAMPLE://a/./b/../b/%63/%7bfoo%7d\") === true\n\n### IP Support\n\n\t//IPv4 normalization\n\tURI.normalize(\"//192.068.001.000\") === \"//192.68.1.0\"\n\n\t//IPv6 normalization\n\tURI.normalize(\"//[2001:0:0DB8::0:0001]\") === \"//[2001:0:db8::1]\"\n\n\t//IPv6 zone identifier support\n\tURI.parse(\"//[2001:db8::7%25en1]\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//  host : \"2001:db8::7%en1\"\n\t//}\n\n### IRI Support\n\n\t//convert IRI to URI\n\tURI.serialize(URI.parse(\"http://examplé.org/rosé\")) === \"http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9\"\n\t//convert URI to IRI\n\tURI.serialize(URI.parse(\"http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9\"), {iri:true}) === \"http://examplé.org/rosé\"\n\n### Options\n\nAll of the above functions can accept an additional options argument that is an object that can contain one or more of the following properties:\n\n*\t`scheme` (string)\n\n\tIndicates the scheme that the URI should be treated as, overriding the URI's normal scheme parsing behavior.\n\n*\t`reference` (string)\n\n\tIf set to `\"suffix\"`, it indicates that the URI is in the suffix format, and the validator will use the option's `scheme` property to determine the URI's scheme.\n\n*\t`tolerant` (boolean, false)\n\n\tIf set to `true`, the parser will relax URI resolving rules.\n\n*\t`absolutePath` (boolean, false)\n\n\tIf set to `true`, the serializer will not resolve a relative `path` component.\n\n*\t`iri` (boolean, false)\n\n\tIf set to `true`, the serializer will unescape non-ASCII characters as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).\n\n*\t`unicodeSupport` (boolean, false)\n\n\tIf set to `true`, the parser will unescape non-ASCII characters in the parsed output as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).\n\n*\t`domainHost` (boolean, false)\n\n\tIf set to `true`, the library will treat the `host` component as a domain name, and convert IDNs (International Domain Names) as per [RFC 5891](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5891.txt).\n\n## Scheme Extendable\n\nURI.js supports inserting custom [scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme) dependent processing rules. Currently, URI.js has built in support for the following schemes:\n\n*\thttp \\[[RFC 2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)\\]\n*\thttps \\[[RFC 2818](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2818.txt)\\]\n*\tmailto \\[[RFC 6068](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6068.txt)\\]\n*\turn \\[[RFC 2141](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt)\\]\n*\turn:uuid \\[[RFC 4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt)\\]\n\n### HTTP Support\n\n\tURI.equal(\"HTTP://ABC.COM:80\", \"http://abc.com/\") === true\n\n### Mailto Support\n\n\tURI.parse(\"mailto:alpha@example.com,bravo@example.com?subject=SUBSCRIBE&body=Sign%20me%20up!\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//\tscheme : \"mailto\",\n\t//\tto : [\"alpha@example.com\", \"bravo@example.com\"],\n\t//\tsubject : \"SUBSCRIBE\",\n\t//\tbody : \"Sign me up!\"\n\t//}\n\n\tURI.serialize({\n\t\tscheme : \"mailto\",\n\t\tto : [\"alpha@example.com\"],\n\t\tsubject : \"REMOVE\",\n\t\tbody : \"Please remove me\",\n\t\theaders : {\n\t\t\tcc : \"charlie@example.com\"\n\t\t}\n\t}) === \"mailto:alpha@example.com?cc=charlie@example.com&subject=REMOVE&body=Please%20remove%20me\"\n\n### URN Support\n\n\tURI.parse(\"urn:example:foo\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//\tscheme : \"urn\",\n\t//\tnid : \"example\",\n\t//\tnss : \"foo\",\n\t//}\n\n#### URN UUID Support\n\n\tURI.parse(\"urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6\");\n\t//returns:\n\t//{\n\t//\tscheme : \"urn\",\n\t//\tnid : \"example\",\n\t//\tuuid : \"f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6\",\n\t//}\n\n## Usage\n\nTo load in a browser, use the following tag:\n\n\t<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"uri-js/dist/es5/uri.all.min.js\"></script>\n\nTo load in a CommonJS (Node.js) environment, first install with npm by running on the command line:\n\n\tnpm install uri-js\n\nThen, in your code, load it using:\n\n\tconst URI = require(\"uri-js\");\n\nIf you are writing your code in ES6+ (ESNEXT) or TypeScript, you would load it using:\n\n\timport * as URI from \"uri-js\";\n\nOr you can load just what you need using named exports:\n\n\timport { parse, serialize, resolve, resolveComponents, normalize, equal, removeDotSegments, pctEncChar, pctDecChars, escapeComponent, unescapeComponent } from \"uri-js\";\n\n## Breaking changes\n\n### Breaking changes from 3.x\n\nURN parsing has been completely changed to better align with the specification. Scheme is now always `urn`, but has two new properties: `nid` which contains the Namspace Identifier, and `nss` which contains the Namespace Specific String. The `nss` property will be removed by higher order scheme handlers, such as the UUID URN scheme handler.\n\nThe UUID of a URN can now be found in the `uuid` property.\n\n### Breaking changes from 2.x\n\nURI validation has been removed as it was slow, exposed a vulnerabilty, and was generally not useful.\n\n### Breaking changes from 1.x\n\nThe `errors` array on parsed components is now an `error` string.\n\n## License ([Simplified BSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#2-clause))\n\nCopyright 2011 Gary Court.

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License.",

    "licenseText": "# ws: a node.js websocket library\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/websockets/ws.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/websockets/ws)\n\n`ws` is a simple to use WebSocket implementation, up-to-date against RFC-6455,\nand [probably the fastest WebSocket library for node.js][archive].\n\nPasses the quite extensive Autobahn test suite. See http://websockets.github.com/ws\nfor the full reports.\n\n## Protocol support\n\n* **Hixie draft 76** (Old and deprecated, but still in use by Safari and Opera.\n  Added to ws version 0.4.2, but server only. Can be disabled by setting the\n  `disableHixie` option to true.)\n* **HyBi drafts 07-12** (Use the option `protocolVersion: 8`)\n* **HyBi drafts 13-17** (Current default, alternatively option `protocolVersion: 13`)\n\n### Installing\n\n```\nnpm install --save ws\n```\n\n### Opt-in for performance\n\nThere are 2 optional modules that can be installed along side with the `ws`\nmodule. These modules are binary addons which improve certain operations, but as\nthey are binary addons they require compilation which can fail if no c++\ncompiler is installed on the host system.\n\n- `npm install --save bufferutil`: Improves internal buffer operations which\n  allows for faster processing of masked WebSocket frames and general buffer\n  operations.\n- `npm install --save utf-8-validate`: The specification requires validation of\n  invalid UTF-8 chars, some of these validations could not be done in JavaScript\n  hence the need for a binary addon. In most cases you will already be\n  validating the input that you receive for security purposes leading to double\n  validation. But if you want to be 100% spec-conforming and have fast\n  validation of UTF-8 then this module is a must.\n\n### Sending and receiving text data\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('ws');\nvar ws = new WebSocket('ws://www.host.com/path');\n\nws.on('open', function open() {\n  ws.send('something');\n});\n\nws.on('message', function(data, flags) {\n  // flags.binary will be set if a binary data is received.\n  // flags.masked will be set if the data was masked.\n});\n```\n\n### Sending binary data\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('ws');\nvar ws = new WebSocket('ws://www.host.com/path');\n\nws.on('open', function open() {\n  var array = new Float32Array(5);\n\n  for (var i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) {\n    array[i] = i / 2;\n  }\n\n  ws.send(array, { binary: true, mask: true });\n});\n```\n\nSetting `mask`, as done for the send options above, will cause the data to be\nmasked according to the WebSocket protocol. The same option applies for text\ndata.\n\n### Server example\n\n```js\nvar WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server\n  , wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });\n\nwss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {\n  ws.on('message', function incoming(message) {\n    console.log('received: %s', message);\n  });\n\n  ws.send('something');\n});\n```\n\n### ExpressJS example\n\n```js\nvar server = require('http').createServer()\n  , url = require('url')\n  , WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server\n  , wss = new WebSocketServer({ server: server })\n  , express = require('express')\n  , app = express()\n  , port = 4080;\n\napp.use(function (req, res) {\n  res.send({ msg: \"hello\" });\n});\n\nwss.on('connection', function connection(ws) {\n  var location = url.parse(ws.upgradeReq.url, true);\n  // you might use location.query.access_token to authenticate or share sessions\n  // or ws.upgradeReq.headers.cookie (see http://stackoverflow.com/a/16395220/151312)\n\n  ws.on('message', function incoming(message) {\n    console.log('received: %s', message);\n  });\n\n  ws.send('something');\n});\n\nserver.on('request', app);\nserver.listen(port, function () { console.log('Listening on ' + server.address().port) });\n```\n\n### Server sending broadcast data\n\n```js\nvar WebSocketServer = require('ws').Server\n  , wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });\n\nwss.broadcast = function broadcast(data) {\n  wss.clients.forEach(function each(client) {\n    client.send(data);\n  });\n};\n```\n\n### Error handling best practices\n\n```js\n// If the WebSocket is closed before the following send is attempted\nws.send('something');\n\n// Errors (both immediate and async write errors) can be detected in an optional\n// callback. The callback is also the only way of being notified that data has\n// actually been sent.\nws.send('something', function ack(error) {\n  // if error is not defined, the send has been completed,\n  // otherwise the error object will indicate what failed.\n});\n\n// Immediate errors can also be handled with try/catch-blocks, but **note** that\n// since sends are inherently asynchronous, socket write failures will *not* be\n// captured when this technique is used.\ntry { ws.send('something'); }\ncatch (e) { /* handle error */ }\n```\n\n### echo.websocket.org demo\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('ws');\nvar ws = new WebSocket('ws://echo.websocket.org/', {\n  protocolVersion: 8,\n  origin: 'http://websocket.org'\n});\n\nws.on('open', function open() {\n  console.log('connected');\n  ws.send(Date.now().toString(), {mask: true});\n});\n\nws.on('close', function close() {\n  console.log('disconnected');\n});\n\nws.on('message', function message(data, flags) {\n  console.log('Roundtrip time: ' + (Date.now() - parseInt(data)) + 'ms', flags);\n\n  setTimeout(function timeout() {\n    ws.send(Date.now().toString(), {mask: true});\n  }, 500);\n});\n```\n\n### Other examples\n\nFor a full example with a browser client communicating with a ws server, see the\nexamples folder.\n\nNote that the usage together with Express 3.0 is quite different from Express\n2.x. The difference is expressed in the two different serverstats-examples.\n\nOtherwise, see the test cases.\n\n### Running the tests\n\n```\nmake test\n```\n\n## API Docs\n\nSee [`/doc/ws.md`](https://github.com/websockets/ws/blob/master/doc/ws.md) for Node.js-like docs for the ws classes.\n\n## Changelog\n\nWe're using the GitHub [`releases`](https://github.com/websockets/ws/releases) for changelog entries.\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 Einar Otto Stangvik &lt;einaros@gmail.com&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[archive]: http://web.archive.org/web/20130314230536/http://hobbycoding.posterous.com/the-fastest-websocket-module-for-nodejs",

    "licenseText": "[XRegExp](http://xregexp.com/)\r\n==============================\r\n\r\nXRegExp provides augmented, extensible, cross-browser JavaScript regular expressions. You get new syntax and flags beyond what browsers support natively, along with a collection of utils to make your client-side grepping and parsing easier. XRegExp also frees you from worrying about pesky inconsistencies in cross-browser regex handling and the dubious `lastIndex` property.\r\n\r\nXRegExp supports all native ES5 regular expression syntax. It's about 3.5 KB when minified and gzipped. It works with Internet Explorer 5.5+, Firefox 1.5+, Chrome, Safari 3+, and Opera 9.5+.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n\r\nXRegExp regular expressions compile to native RegExp objects, thus there is no performance difference when using XRegExp objects with native methods. There is a small performance cost when *compiling* XRegExps. If you want, however, you can use `XRegExp.cache` to avoid ever incurring the compilation cost for a given pattern more than once. Doing so can even lead to XRegExp being faster than native regexes in synthetic tests that repeatedly compile the same regex.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage examples\r\n\r\n~~~ js\r\n// Using named capture and flag x (free-spacing and line comments)\r\nvar date = XRegExp('(?<year>  [0-9]{4}) -?  # year  \\n\\\r\n                    (?<month> [0-9]{2}) -?  # month \\n\\\r\n                    (?<day>   [0-9]{2})     # day   ', 'x');\r\n\r\n// XRegExp.exec gives you named backreferences on the match result\r\nvar match = XRegExp.exec('2012-02-22', date);\r\nmatch.day; // -> '22'\r\n\r\n// It also includes optional pos and sticky arguments\r\nvar pos = 3, result = [];\r\nwhile (match = XRegExp.exec('<1><2><3><4>5<6>', /<(\\d+)>/, pos, 'sticky')) {\r\n    result.push(match[1]);\r\n    pos = match.index + match[0].length;\r\n} // result -> ['2', '3', '4']\r\n\r\n// XRegExp.replace allows named backreferences in replacements\r\nXRegExp.replace('2012-02-22', date, '${month}/${day}/${year}'); // -> '02/22/2012'\r\nXRegExp.replace('2012-02-22', date, function (match) {\r\n    return match.month + '/' + match.day + '/' + match.year;\r\n}); // -> '02/22/2012'\r\n\r\n// In fact, all XRegExps are RegExps and work perfectly with native methods\r\ndate.test('2012-02-22'); // -> true\r\n\r\n// The *only* caveat is that named captures must be referred to using numbered backreferences\r\n'2012-02-22'.replace(date, '$2/$3/$1'); // -> '02/22/2012'\r\n\r\n// If you want, you can extend native methods so you don't have to worry about this\r\n// Doing so also fixes numerous browser bugs in the native methods\r\nXRegExp.install('natives');\r\n'2012-02-22'.replace(date, '${month}/${day}/${year}'); // -> '02/22/2012'\r\n'2012-02-22'.replace(date, function (match) {\r\n    return match.month + '/' + match.day + '/' + match.year;\r\n}); // -> '02/22/2012'\r\ndate.exec('2012-02-22').day; // -> '22'\r\n\r\n// Extract every other digit from a string using XRegExp.forEach\r\nXRegExp.forEach('1a2345', /\\d/, function (match, i) {\r\n    if (i % 2) this.push(+match[0]);\r\n}, []); // -> [2, 4]\r\n\r\n// Get numbers within <b> tags using XRegExp.matchChain\r\nXRegExp.matchChain('1 <b>2</b> 3 <b>4 a 56</b>', [\r\n    XRegExp('(?is)<b>.*?</b>'),\r\n    /\\d+/\r\n]); // -> ['2', '4', '56']\r\n\r\n// You can also pass forward and return specific backreferences\r\nvar html = '<a href=\"http://xregexp.com/\">XRegExp</a>\\\r\n            <a href=\"http://www.google.com/\">Google</a>';\r\nXRegExp.matchChain(html, [\r\n    {regex: /<a href=\"([^\"]+)\">/i, backref: 1},\r\n    {regex: XRegExp('(?i)^https?://(?<domain>[^/?#]+)'), backref: 'domain'}\r\n]); // -> ['xregexp.com', 'www.google.com']\r\n\r\n// XRegExp.union safely merges strings and regexes into a single pattern\r\nXRegExp.union(['a+b*c', /(dogs)\\1/, /(cats)\\1/], 'i');\r\n// -> /a\\+b\\*c|(dogs)\\1|(cats)\\2/i\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThese examples should give you the flavor of what's possible, but XRegExp has more syntax, flags, utils, options, and browser fixes that aren't shown here. You can even augment XRegExp's regular expression syntax with addons (see below) or write your own. See [xregexp.com](http://xregexp.com/) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Addons\r\n\r\nIn browsers, you can either load addons individually, or bundle all addons together with XRegExp by loading `xregexp-all.js`. XRegExp's [npm](http://npmjs.org/) package uses `xregexp-all.js`, which means that the addons are always available when XRegExp is installed on the server using npm.\r\n\r\n\r\n### XRegExp Unicode Base\r\n\r\nIn browsers, first include the Unicode Base script:\r\n\r\n~~~ html\r\n<script src=\"xregexp.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"addons/unicode/unicode-base.js\"></script>\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThen you can do this:\r\n\r\n~~~ js\r\nvar unicodeWord = XRegExp('^\\\\p{L}+$');\r\nunicodeWord.test('Русский'); // -> true\r\nunicodeWord.test('日本語'); // -> true\r\nunicodeWord.test('العربية'); // -> true\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThe base script adds `\\p{Letter}` and its alias `\\p{L}`, but other Unicode categories, scripts, blocks, and properties require addon packages. Try these next examples after additionally including `unicode-scripts.js`:\r\n\r\n~~~ js\r\nXRegExp('^\\\\p{Hiragana}+$').test('ひらがな'); // -> true\r\nXRegExp('^[\\\\p{Latin}\\\\p{Common}]+$').test('Über Café.'); // -> true\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nXRegExp uses the Unicode 6.1 Basic Multilingual Plane.\r\n\r\n\r\n### XRegExp.build\r\n\r\nIn browsers, first include the script:\r\n\r\n~~~ html\r\n<script src=\"xregexp.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"addons/build.js\"></script>\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nYou can then build regular expressions using named subpatterns, for readability and pattern reuse:\r\n\r\n~~~ js\r\nvar time = XRegExp.build('(?x)^ {{hours}} ({{minutes}}) $', {\r\n    hours: XRegExp.build('{{h12}} : | {{h24}}', {\r\n        h12: /1[0-2]|0?[1-9]/,\r\n        h24: /2[0-3]|[01][0-9]/\r\n    }, 'x'),\r\n    minutes: /^[0-5][0-9]$/\r\n});\r\n\r\ntime.test('10:59'); // -> true\r\nXRegExp.exec('10:59', time).minutes; // -> '59'\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nNamed subpatterns can be provided as strings or regex objects. A leading `^` and trailing unescaped `$` are stripped from subpatterns if both are present, which allows embedding independently useful anchored patterns. `{{…}}` tokens can be quantified as a single unit. Backreferences in the outer pattern and provided subpatterns are automatically renumbered to work correctly within the larger combined pattern. The syntax `({{name}})` works as shorthand for named capture via `(?<name>{{name}})`. Named subpatterns cannot be embedded within character classes.\r\n\r\nSee also: *[Creating Grammatical Regexes Using XRegExp.build](http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/grammatical-patterns-xregexp-build)*.\r\n\r\n\r\n### XRegExp.matchRecursive\r\n\r\nIn browsers, first include the script:\r\n\r\n~~~ html\r\n<script src=\"xregexp.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"addons/matchrecursive.js\"></script>\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nYou can then match recursive constructs using XRegExp pattern strings as left and right delimiters:\r\n\r\n~~~ js\r\nvar str = '(t((e))s)t()(ing)';\r\nXRegExp.matchRecursive(str, '\\\\(', '\\\\)', 'g');\r\n// -> ['t((e))s', '', 'ing']\r\n\r\n// Extended information mode with valueNames\r\nstr = 'Here is <div> <div>an</div></div> example';\r\nXRegExp.matchRecursive(str, '<div\\\\s*>', '</div>', 'gi', {\r\n    valueNames: ['between', 'left', 'match', 'right']\r\n});\r\n/* -> [\r\n{name: 'between', value: 'Here is ',       start: 0,  end: 8},\r\n{name: 'left',    value: '<div>',          start: 8,  end: 13},\r\n{name: 'match',   value: ' <div>an</div>', start: 13, end: 27},\r\n{name: 'right',   value: '</div>',         start: 27, end: 33},\r\n{name: 'between', value: ' example',       start: 33, end: 41}\r\n] */\r\n\r\n// Omitting unneeded parts with null valueNames, and using escapeChar\r\nstr = '...{1}\\\\{{function(x,y){return y+x;}}';\r\nXRegExp.matchRecursive(str, '{', '}', 'g', {\r\n    valueNames: ['literal', null, 'value', null],\r\n    escapeChar: '\\\\'\r\n});\r\n/* -> [\r\n{name: 'literal', value: '...', start: 0, end: 3},\r\n{name: 'value',   value: '1',   start: 4, end: 5},\r\n{name: 'literal', value: '\\\\{', start: 6, end: 8},\r\n{name: 'value',   value: 'function(x,y){return y+x;}', start: 9, end: 35}\r\n] */\r\n\r\n// Sticky mode via flag y\r\nstr = '<1><<<2>>><3>4<5>';\r\nXRegExp.matchRecursive(str, '<', '>', 'gy');\r\n// -> ['1', '<<2>>', '3']\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n`XRegExp.matchRecursive` throws an error if it sees an unbalanced delimiter in the target string.\r\n\r\n\r\n### XRegExp Prototype Methods\r\n\r\nIn browsers, first include the script:\r\n\r\n~~~ html\r\n<script src=\"xregexp.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"addons/prototypes.js\"></script>\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nNew XRegExp regexes then gain a collection of useful methods: `apply`, `call`, `forEach`, `globalize`, `xexec`, and `xtest`.\r\n\r\n~~~ js\r\n// To demonstrate the call method, let's first create the function we'll be using...\r\nfunction filter(array, fn) {\r\n    var res = [];\r\n    array.forEach(function (el) {if (fn.call(null, el)) res.push(el);});\r\n    return res;\r\n}\r\n// Now we can filter arrays using functions and regexes\r\nfilter(['a', 'ba', 'ab', 'b'], XRegExp('^a')); // -> ['a', 'ab']\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nNative `RegExp` objects copied by `XRegExp` are augmented with any `XRegExp.prototype` methods. The following lines therefore work equivalently:\r\n\r\n~~~ js\r\nXRegExp('[a-z]', 'ig').xexec('abc');\r\nXRegExp(/[a-z]/ig).xexec('abc');\r\nXRegExp.globalize(/[a-z]/i).xexec('abc');\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation and usage\r\n\r\nIn browsers:\r\n\r\n~~~ html\r\n<script src=\"xregexp-min.js\"></script>\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nOr, to bundle XRegExp with all of its addons:\r\n\r\n~~~ html\r\n<script src=\"xregexp-all-min.js\"></script>\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nUsing [npm](http://npmjs.org/):\r\n\r\n~~~ bash\r\nnpm install xregexp\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nIn [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [CommonJS module](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules) loaders:\r\n\r\n~~~ js\r\nvar XRegExp = require('xregexp').XRegExp;\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n\r\n### Running tests on the server with npm\r\n\r\n~~~ bash\r\nnpm install -g qunit  # needed to run the tests\r\nnpm test  # in the xregexp root\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nIf XRegExp was not installed using npm, just open `tests/index.html` in your browser.\r\n\r\n\r\n## &c\r\n\r\n**Lookbehind:** A [collection of short functions](https://gist.github.com/2387872) is available that makes it easy to simulate infinite-length leading lookbehind.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n* Releases: [Version history](http://xregexp.com/history/).\r\n* Upcoming: [Milestones](https://github.com/slevithan/XRegExp/issues/milestones), [Roadmap](https://github.com/slevithan/XRegExp/wiki/Roadmap).\r\n\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\nXRegExp and addons copyright 2007-2012 by [Steven Levithan](http://stevenlevithan.com/).\r\n\r\nTools: Unicode range generators by [Mathias Bynens](http://mathiasbynens.be/).
