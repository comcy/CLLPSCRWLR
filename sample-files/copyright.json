The\nfollowing considerations are for informational purposes only, are not\nexhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are\n intended for use by those authorized to give the public\n permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\n copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\n irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any\n material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-\n licensed material, or material used under an exception or\n limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:\n\twiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\n\n Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\n licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\n licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\n the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\n Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n respect those requests where reasonable.

Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n agreements.\n\n e.

The\n Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n 5. Downstream recipients.\n\n a.

Every\n recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n Public License.\n\n b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n Material.\n\n 6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n b. Other rights.\n\n 1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n 2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n Public License.\n\n 3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n a. Attribution.\n\n 1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n form), You must:\n\n a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n with the Licensed Material:\n\n i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n Material and any others designated to receive\n attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n designated);\n\n ii. a copyright notice;\n\n iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n warranties;\n\n v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n extent reasonably practicable;\n\n b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n 2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n information.\n\n 3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n reasonably practicable.\n\n 4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n portion of the contents of the database;\n\n b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n terminate automatically.\n\n b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n 1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n violation; or\n\n 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n of this Public License.\n\n c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n will not terminate this Public License.\n\n d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n conditions.\n\n c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n Licensor.\n\n d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form. 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions: You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License. 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions. 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file. 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License. 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS" }, "regenerate@1.4.0": { "licenses": "MIT", "repository": "https://github.com/mathiasbynens/regenerate", "publisher": "Mathias Bynens", "url": "https://mathiasbynens.be/", "name": "regenerate", "version": "1.4.0", "copyright": "Copyright Mathias Bynens <https://mathiasbynens.be/>", "licenseText": "Copyright Mathias Bynens <https://mathiasbynens.be/>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.

DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN \"AS-IS\" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER. Statement of Purpose The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \"owner\") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a \"Work\"). Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works (\"Commons\") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others. For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights. 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following: i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work; ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s); iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work; iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below; v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work; vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof. 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. 4. Limitations and Disclaimers. a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document. b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law. c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work. d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work." }, "spdy-transport@2.1.0": { "licenses": "MIT", "repository": "https://github.com/spdy-http2/spdy-transport", "publisher": "Fedor Indutny", "email": "fedor@indutny.com", "name": "spdy-transport", "version": "2.1.0", "copyright": "Copyright Fedor Indutny, 2015.", "licenseText": "This software is licensed under the MIT License.\n\nCopyright Fedor Indutny, 2015.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\n4.

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\r\n\r\n5.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS" }, "uglify-js@2.3.6": { "licenses": "BSD*", "repository": "https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2", "name": "uglify-js", "version": "2.3.6", "copyright": "Copyright 2012-2013 (c) Mihai Bazon <mihai.bazon@gmail.com>", "licenseText": "UglifyJS is released under the BSD license:\n\nCopyright 2012-2013 (c) Mihai Bazon <mihai.bazon@gmail.com>\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions\nare met:\n\n * Redistributions of source code must retain the above\n copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n disclaimer.\n\n * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above\n copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials\n provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER “AS IS” AND ANY\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
